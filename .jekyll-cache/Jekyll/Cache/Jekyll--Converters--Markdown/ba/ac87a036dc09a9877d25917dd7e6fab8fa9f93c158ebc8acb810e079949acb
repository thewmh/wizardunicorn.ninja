<p>*Caught the horizontal plague Ã‡ÃŸâˆ‚Æ’Â©Ã§â‰ˆÃ§âˆšË†Â¨Â¥â€ Â®Â´</p>

<p>10/8</p>

<p><em>Finished the SXA training seriesâ€™. Moving back to Accessibility in JavaScript. Also have CSS manifest for ab to pore over as well</em></p>

<p>Accessibility in JavaScript @ 30mins left. Have nice notes on Medium and the forked repo on github with comments all over the code as it comes in the workshop. Had a nice conversation with my surpervisor about BED and FED working together and how it doesnâ€™t always work well, lessons learned, and how to move forward.</p>

<p>10/7</p>

<p>Thought I had no meetings, so I decided to WFH. At 08:30 a PM reached out and asked if I was coming to Scrum. Yes? But it wasnâ€™t on my calendar. Spent the day going through the SXA Rendering Variant set of videos. Thereâ€™s a lot of little things to consider when setting up a project on such a large platform, but if you can make the pieces smaller and smaller and understand how it all comes together, then it should be manageable. The break point between FED and BED is still unclear, but I think the SXA series is mostly geared towards FEDs, Content Authors, and Marketeers, so all the BED things are somewhere else?</p>

<p>10/4</p>

<p>I am now on ab half-time and have the other half of my time to do other things? There is plenty to keep me busy, I am finishing up SXA training, which is documented on the resources page. After that, I still have to finish Accessibility in JavaScript AND HR had sent over some trainings for me to complete. Yay.</p>

<p>Stackla update: FED won</p>

<p>10/3</p>

<p>Well well wellâ€¦ I used up all my allocation for mwt by noon yesterday and then started in on ab sxa business. We had the ab stand-up this morning and I was the only one who had cleared my plate to start in on the SXA trainingsâ€¦ Today I reported in for the mwt standup that I had passed off my ticket and it was in a good place, but after a day with Stackla, guess who won? Stacklaâ€¦ Anyway, I wrote up a bunch more notes about the SXA training, thatâ€™s over on my Resources page. I also figured out how to use markdown_helper to organize (complicate) my work here a bit more. SXA is pretty WYSIWYG(y), and it is yet unclear how BED and FED will work together using this platform, but I hope it proves useful and worth all the trouble!</p>

<p><em>had to get out of Stackla and mwt. Only had half time this week for that and ab, so mwt is out for the week. Moving on to ab, started learning sxa thangs.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>mwt 56 - pip product reviews - made some good progress on this. Got the base set for the layout of the page in mobile and desktop views, but the functional requirements are not yet met. Having to pass this back to the other FED on the project to implement, but would have needed their help on this component nonetheless. Oh JavaScript, there is so much to learn. Stackla wins.</li>
</ul>

<p>me: 1, stackla: 2</p>

<p><em>spent the whole day in Stackla. I have nothing but inappropriate things to writeâ€¦</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>mwt 56 - pip product reviews - the fight continues. I did find that we may have been using the wrong base template for the social card widget on Stackla. Switched to another template and have found a greater deal of flexibility working with this thing, but Iâ€™m still giving Stackla a point for the day, because they win.</li>
</ul>
