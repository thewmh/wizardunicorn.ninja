<ul>
  <li>Difficulty ramps up considerably, but if you stick with it you will reap the rewards</li>
  <li>Take responsibility for your learning - don’t make excuses for why you cannot learn something, figure out how to measure your learning (it is different for everyone)</li>
  <li>Consider the questions asked</li>
  <li>Don’t read too much. If you are trying to learn a skill that requires you to solve problems, it’s not always as productive as it may feel</li>
</ul>
