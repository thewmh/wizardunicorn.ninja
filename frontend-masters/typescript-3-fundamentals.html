<p>Have TypeScript installed ? Continue to workshop : <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm install typescript -g</code></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>

<p>Our instructor for this workshop, Mike North, leads workshops at LinkedIn. He is also a tech lead on the frontend stack with a focus on TypeScript adoption. Great, but what is <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>?</p>

<ul>
  <li>An open-source <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">typed</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">syntactic superset</code> of JavaScript, developed by <strong>Microsoft</strong></li>
  <li>Compiles to readable JavaScript</li>
  <li>Comes in three parts: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Language</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Language Server</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Compiler</code></li>
  <li>Works seamlessly with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Babel 7</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The types in TypeScript ‘disappear’ in the final compiled JavaScript, so you can think of TypeScript as a static analysis tool that does a lot of checking on your codebase. This is good in some ways, bad in others. Good because there is no ‘cost’ at runtime, bad because a fetched data response or user input will have no type-checking. You can think of TypeScript as a ‘fancy’ linter or other static analysis tool that verifies everything looks good, but does not produce any output.</p>

<p>Since the original edition of this workshop in 2017, there has been a +300% increase in TypeScript downloads, tying TypeScript’s downloads and prevalence of use with that of React.</p>

<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>

<p>…why add types?</p>

<ul>
  <li>To encode constraints and assumptions, as part of developer intent</li>
  <li>Catch common mistakes (i.e. incomplete refactors)</li>
  <li>Move some runtime errors to compile time</li>
  <li>Provide your consumers (including you) with a great DX (Developer Experience)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h3>

<p>We’re about to learn about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adding type information to variables, functions, and classes</li>
  <li>Configuring the compiler</li>
  <li>A practical strategy for incrementally converting JS to TS</li>
  <li>Parameterizing interfaces and type aliases with generics</li>
  <li>Conditional, mapped, and branded types</li>
  <li>TS Compiler API Basics</li>
</ul>

<p>While we will not be covering every single facet of TypeScript and its capabilities, our instructors goal is to leave us with a great mental model of how to think about TypeScript. Configuring the compiler is important because it can be the difference between shrinking code by 70%, i.e. if we were building for IE6, the code would be much larger because there are less features available in that browser. In the compiler you can also set how strict the rules are. We’ll also get a peek under the ‘hood’ of TypeScript and gain an understanding of how TypeScript understands our code and how it splits it apart and represents our code in data structures.</p>

<p>⚠ from here forward, the workshop will be working from the repository listed at the top of these notes. If you would like to follow along, and get the most out of the workshop, clone the repository and follow the installation instructions before proceeding ⚠️</p>

<h3 id="flags">Flags</h3>

<p>Right… Hopefully you’ve read the little warning note above. If not, go read it now, we’re waiting…</p>

<p>Now that you have the repository cloned and dependencies installed, take a look at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./examples/hello-ts/</code> because we are going to learn how to use the TypeScript compiler to turn TypeScript into JavaScript. Open up the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.ts</code> file from the path just mentioned <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./examples/hello-ts/src/index.ts</code>. In that file, you will see a couple of functions and then a ‘program’ that runs the functions. If for whatever reason you’ve refused to grab the repository or for some reason cannot, here’s the code from that file:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="cm">/**
 * Create a promise that resolves after some time
 * @param n number of milliseconds before promise resolves
 */</span>
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">timeout</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">n</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">number</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Promise</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">res</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nx">setTimeout</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">n</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="cm">/**
 * Add three numbers

 * @param b second
 */</span>
<span class="k">export</span> <span class="k">async</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addNumbers</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">number</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">number</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">await</span> <span class="nx">timeout</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">500</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">//== Run the program ==//</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">async</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">await</span> <span class="nx">addNumbers</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">})();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above code is pretty basic; there’s a promise that is basically a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code> wrapped in a promise, a function that adds two numbers, and the ‘run the program’ function. The instructor explains that this was chosen because it is using some modern syntax that is not supported by all browsers, and we should like to see some different ways of compiling the code to support whatever browsers we need. It is important that you are using VS Code for this workshop as it is the editor that is more or less built hand-in-hand with TypeScript. In the terminal, change directories to the example project <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd examples/hello-ts/</code>. Then we should run the TypeScript compiler on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.ts</code> file by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsc src/index.ts</code> in the terminal. You should now have a file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.js</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src</code> folder. Take a look at them side by side!</p>

<p>You may notice that the file from the TypeScript compiler is significantly larger and hard to decipher, this is ES3 JavaScript! It will work in IE6, this is the default. By default the TypeScript compiler builds JavaScript that you can run basically anywhere. We can add a flag to the compiler command that will allow us to control the level at which the code is compiled, try:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsc src/index.ts --target ES2015</code></p>

<p>You should see pretty immediately that the amount of code has been dramatically reduced. There is still some (extra) code that is there for compatibility reasons, but now you will see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Promise</code> remains as that is a part of ES6 / ES2015. You might also take not of the fact that async/await are non-existent as they were not a part of JavaScript at ES2015. Now try:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsc src/index.ts --target ES2017</code></p>

<p>Boom! async / await are back! The only difference now between the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.ts</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.js</code> files <em>should be</em> the parameter typing, i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a: number</code> is just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code>. Try running the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.js</code> file with node: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">node src/index.js</code> — this should result in an error: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SyntaxError: Unexpected token exoprt</code> The reason for this is how node uses exports. The correct syntax should be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">module.exports</code> not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">export</code>. Node uses commonjs modules. To fix this issue, lets add another flag to the TypeScript compile command:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsc src/index.ts --target ES2017 --module commonjs</code></p>

<p>You will see the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.js</code> file from the compiler has been updated yet again. This time you can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">node src/index.js</code> and, after 500 milliseconds, you will see 7 print out in the console! If you add the ‘watch’ flag, the TypeScript compiler will continue to watch for changes in the source files, compiling them again whenever there are changes made:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsc src/index.ts --target ES2017 --module commonjs --watch</code></p>

<h3 id="configuring-typescript">Configuring TypeScript</h3>

<p>Having learned some flags and compiler commands is great, but do we have to type all that every time? Nope! Let’s get a configuration file set up! In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello-ts</code> folder, create a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsconfig.json</code>. We’ll look at how to set that config file up in a moment. There are 2 things that you need to think about when configuring the compiler; First is defining which files are the inputs. You can do that by specifying a list of files, i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"files": []</code> OR <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"include": []</code> (which allows you to include files using ‘globs’ <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.ts</code>). The second to consider when setting up your config file is the compiler options, what are they? Well, the compiler options are basically the flags we saw in the last section but in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"compilerOptions"</code> object in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsconfig.json</code> file. And if you are being a good person and are using VS Code as you’ve been asked to, you will get some helper text / suggestions for setting this file up! Once your config file is set up, you can simply run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsc</code> and see the file(s) output according to your configuration file! Here’s what we ended up with for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsconfig.json</code>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">compilerOptions</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, with your new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsconfig.json</code> file, you can type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsc</code> in the terminal and you should now see a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib</code> directory with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.js</code> inside of it! 🔥</p>

<p>Now we could push all this up to source control and deploy only our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib</code> directory, which is great, but the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.js</code> output file contains a lot of ‘type’ stuff that is maybe no longer relevant? Let’s add a couple more options to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"compilerOptions"</code> object in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsconfig.json</code> file:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">compilerOptions</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>
    <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">declaration</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">sourceMap</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">include</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">src</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="c1">// what files to include when compiling</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Run the compiler again, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsc</code>, and you should see a couple of new files pop up in the output directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib</code>. One of the files is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.d.ts</code>, if you look at it, kind of looks like a function with no implementation. It is actually a type declaration file that is intended to layer on top of the JavaScript that it represents. If you are using a TypeScript aware code editor :cough:cough: VS Code :cough:cough: it will read this file and understand that this file is intended to be matched with your JavaScript and that the types declared within are meant to go along with the JavaScript code.</p>

<p>The other (new) file is a sourcemap <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.js.map</code> which would allow us, if there were breakpoints in the code, map us back to the original TypeScript source. This gives the developer experience of debugging through TypeScript code when in fact that is not what is running, because what actually runs is JavaScript. Here is a more complex configuration to look at:</p>

<p>Q: How would your config look if you wanted to support IE11? Or no IE? (Using Babel)</p>

<p>A: Have TypeScript emit very modern JavaScript and have Babel take it (the compilation) the rest of the way. You can leave your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"target"</code> as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"ESNext"</code>, and in the Babel configuration define whatever browsers you want/need to support.</p>
