<p>Have TypeScript installed ? Continue to workshop : <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm install typescript -g</code></p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>

<p>Our instructor for this workshop, Mike North, leads workshops at LinkedIn. He is also a tech lead on the frontend stack with a focus on TypeScript adoption. Great, but what is <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>?</p>

<ul>
  <li>An open-source <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">typed</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">syntactic superset</code> of JavaScript, developed by <strong>Microsoft</strong></li>
  <li>Compiles to readable JavaScript</li>
  <li>Comes in three parts: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Language</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Language Server</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Compiler</code></li>
  <li>Works seamlessly with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Babel 7</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The types in TypeScript ‘disappear’ in the final compiled JavaScript, so you can think of TypeScript as a static analysis tool that does a lot of checking on your codebase. This is good in some ways, bad in others. Good because there is no ‘cost’ at runtime, bad because a fetched data response or user input will have no type-checking. You can think of TypeScript as a ‘fancy’ linter or other static analysis tool that verifies everything looks good, but does not produce any output.</p>

<p>Since the original edition of this workshop in 2017, there has been a +300% increase in TypeScript downloads, tying TypeScript’s downloads and prevalence of use with that of React.</p>

<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>

<p>…why add types?</p>

<ul>
  <li>To encode constraints and assumptions, as part of developer intent</li>
  <li>Catch common mistakes (i.e. incomplete refactors)</li>
  <li>Move some runtime errors to compile time</li>
  <li>Provide your consumers (including you) with a great DX (Developer Experience)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h3>

<p>We’re about to learn about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adding type information to variables, functions, and classes</li>
  <li>Configuring the compiler</li>
  <li>A practical strategy for incrementally converting JS to TS</li>
  <li>Parameterizing interfaces and type aliases with generics</li>
  <li>Conditional, mapped, and branded types</li>
  <li>TS Compiler API Basics</li>
</ul>

<p>While we will not be covering every single facet of TypeScript and its capabilities, our instructors goal is to leave us with a great mental model of how to think about TypeScript. Configuring the compiler is important because it can be the difference between shrinking code by 70%, i.e. if we were building for IE6, the code would be much larger because there are less features available in that browser. In the compiler you can also set how strict the rules are. We’ll also get a peek under the ‘hood’ of TypeScript and gain an understanding of how TypeScript understands our code and how it splits it apart and represents our code in data structures.</p>

<p>⚠ from here forward, the workshop will be working from the repository listed at the top of these notes. If you would like to follow along, and get the most out of the workshop, clone the repository and follow the installation instructions before proceeding ⚠️</p>

<h3 id="flags">Flags</h3>

<p>Right… Hopefully you’ve read the little warning note above. If not, go read it now, we’re waiting…</p>

<p>Now that you have the repository cloned and dependencies installed, take a look at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./examples/hello-ts/</code> because we are going to learn how to use the TypeScript compiler to turn TypeScript into JavaScript. Open up the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.ts</code> file from the path just mentioned <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./examples/hello-ts/src/index.ts</code>. In that file, you will see a couple of functions and then a ‘program’ that runs the functions. If for whatever reason you’ve refused to grab the repository or for some reason cannot, here’s the code from that file:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="cm">/**
 * Create a promise that resolves after some time
 * @param n number of milliseconds before promise resolves
 */</span>
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">timeout</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">n</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">number</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Promise</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">res</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nx">setTimeout</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">n</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="cm">/**
 * Add three numbers

 * @param b second
 */</span>
<span class="k">export</span> <span class="k">async</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addNumbers</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">number</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">number</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">await</span> <span class="nx">timeout</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">500</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">//== Run the program ==//</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="k">async</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">await</span> <span class="nx">addNumbers</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">})();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above code is pretty basic; there’s a promise that is basically a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setTimeout</code> wrapped in a promise, a function that adds two numbers, and the ‘run the program’ function. The instructor explains that this was chosen because it is using some modern syntax that is not supported by all browsers, and we should like to see some different ways of compiling the code to support whatever browsers we need. It is important that you are using VS Code for this workshop as it is the editor that is more or less built hand-in-hand with TypeScript. In the terminal, change directories to the example project <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd examples/hello-ts/</code>. Then we should run the TypeScript compiler on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.ts</code> file by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsc src/index.ts</code> in the terminal. You should now have a file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.js</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src</code> folder. Take a look at them side by side!</p>

<p>You may notice that the file from the TypeScript compiler is significantly larger and hard to decipher, this is ES3 JavaScript! It will work in IE6, this is the default. By default the TypeScript compiler builds JavaScript that you can run basically anywhere. We can add a flag to the compiler command that will allow us to control the level at which the code is compiled, try:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsc src/index.ts --target ES2015</code></p>

<p>You should see pretty immediately that the amount of code has been dramatically reduced. There is still some (extra) code that is there for compatibility reasons, but now you will see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Promise</code> remains as that is a part of ES6 / ES2015. You might also take not of the fact that async/await are non-existent as they were not a part of JavaScript at ES2015. Now try:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsc src/index.ts --target ES2017</code></p>

<p>Boom! async / await are back! The only difference now between the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.ts</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.js</code> files <em>should be</em> the parameter typing, i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a: number</code> is just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code>. Try running the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.js</code> file with node: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">node src/index.js</code> — this should result in an error: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SyntaxError: Unexpected token exoprt</code> The reason for this is how node uses exports. The correct syntax should be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">module.exports</code> not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">export</code>. Node uses commonjs modules. To fix this issue, lets add another flag to the TypeScript compile command:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsc src/index.ts --target ES2017 --module commonjs</code></p>

<p>You will see the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.js</code> file from the compiler has been updated yet again. This time you can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">node src/index.js</code> and, after 500 milliseconds, you will see 7 print out in the console! If you add the ‘watch’ flag, the TypeScript compiler will continue to watch for changes in the source files, compiling them again whenever there are changes made:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsc src/index.ts --target ES2017 --module commonjs --watch</code></p>

<h3 id="configuring-typescript">Configuring TypeScript</h3>

<p>Having learned some flags and compiler commands is great, but do we have to type all that every time? Nope! Let’s get a configuration file set up! In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hello-ts</code> folder, create a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsconfig.json</code>. We’ll look at how to set that config file up in a moment. There are 2 things that you need to think about when configuring the compiler; First is defining which files are the inputs. You can do that by specifying a list of files, i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"files": []</code> OR <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"include": []</code> (which allows you to include files using ‘globs’ <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.ts</code>). The second to consider when setting up your config file is the compiler options, what are they? Well, the compiler options are basically the flags we saw in the last section but in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"compilerOptions"</code> object in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsconfig.json</code> file. And if you are being a good person and are using VS Code as you’ve been asked to, you will get some helper text / suggestions for setting this file up! Once your config file is set up, you can simply run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsc</code> and see the file(s) output according to your configuration file! Here’s what we ended up with for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsconfig.json</code>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">compilerOptions</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, with your new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsconfig.json</code> file, you can type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsc</code> in the terminal and you should now see a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib</code> directory with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.js</code> inside of it! 🔥</p>

<p>Now we could push all this up to source control and deploy only our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib</code> directory, which is great, but the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.js</code> output file contains a lot of ‘type’ stuff that is maybe no longer relevant? Let’s add a couple more options to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"compilerOptions"</code> object in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsconfig.json</code> file:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">compilerOptions</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>
    <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">declaration</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">sourceMap</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">include</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">src</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="c1">// what files to include when compiling</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Run the compiler again, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsc</code>, and you should see a couple of new files pop up in the output directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lib</code>. One of the files is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.d.ts</code>, if you look at it, kind of looks like a function with no implementation. It is actually a type declaration file that is intended to layer on top of the JavaScript that it represents. If you are using a TypeScript aware code editor :cough:cough: VS Code :cough:cough: it will read this file and understand that this file is intended to be matched with your JavaScript and that the types declared within are meant to go along with the JavaScript code.</p>

<p>The other (new) file is a sourcemap <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.js.map</code> which would allow us, if there were breakpoints in the code, map us back to the original TypeScript source. This gives the developer experience of debugging through TypeScript code when in fact that is not what is running, because what actually runs is JavaScript. Here is a more complex configuration to look at:</p>

<p>Q: How would your config look if you wanted to support IE11? Or no IE? (Using Babel)</p>

<p>A: Have TypeScript emit very modern JavaScript and have Babel take it (the compilation) the rest of the way. You can leave your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"target"</code> as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"ESNext"</code>, and in the Babel configuration define whatever browsers you want/need to support.</p>

<h2 id="typescript-basics">TypeScript Basics</h2>

<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>

<p>We made it through some basic configuration! Let’s jump in to how to add types to modern JavaScript. We’re about to cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(Simple) Variables</li>
  <li>Arrays &amp; Tuples - Ordered Data Structures (tuples are as specific kind of array)</li>
  <li>Objects</li>
  <li>Union &amp; Intersection Types - The equivalent of AND / OR operators</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are following along with the repository code and VS Code, head on over to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./notes/1-basics.ts</code>. In there, you can hover over many different things and VS Code will give feedback about what is going on. I’m not going to post all of the code here, but basically, uncomment the various lines where there is code, then hover over the declarations and see what the code editor has to say about them. Here is one example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="cm">/**
 * (1) x is a string, b/c we’ve initialized it
 */</span>
<span class="c1">// let x = "hello world"; // uncomment this line and hover over the 'x'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the example above, when you uncomment the line of code and hover over the ‘x’, you will see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(1) x is a string, b/c we’ve initialized it</code>. In TypeScript, you do not have to explicitly assign a ‘type’ to everything. By assigning a value to a variable at declaration, a ‘type’ is inferred. It is in fact considered bad practice to assign a ‘type’ to every single thing because you then make your program extremely rigid, which is not good.</p>

<p>Moving along… you can reassign the value of ‘x’ to another string, this causes no issues. But trying to reassign ‘x’ to anything other than a string will throw an error. TypeScript does not like that. Next up is dealing with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code>. Assigning a value to a variable declared with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> will give that variable the ‘type’ of whatever value it has been assigned. In the example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const y = "hello world";</code>, the ‘type’ of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> is ‘hello world’. This is known as a ‘literal type’, meaning that you are enumerating a specified value rather than a type.</p>

<p>Q: When the code editor shows a tooltip, is that a feature of the code editors compatibility with TypeScript or is it a feature of TypeScript’s compatibility with JSDoc?</p>

<p>A: Kind of both. TypeScript can understand the comments and the language server is pushing that comment data up to us.</p>

<p>With a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> variable that is an object with properties, you can reassign the value of any property as long as the ‘type’ matches. i.e. you could have something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="na">foo</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">hello</span><span class="dl">'</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">good bye</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="variable-declarations">Variable Declarations</h3>

<p>Still in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./notes/1-basics.ts</code> file, we’re going to look at separating variable declarations and initializations (starting at line 32). A scenario where this could pop up is when the value of the variable may need to change according to a set of conditions; switch/case statement anyone? If you uncomment lines 35-37, then hover over the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z</code> on line 35, you will see that the ‘z’ has a type of any. This literally means that ‘z’ can take any value. This behavior is exactly like JavaScript, but kind of misses the point of using TypeScript. There are places where the ‘any’ type is valid to be used, and your goal is not to purge ‘any’ from your app, but to be certain that where it exists that you do in fact want to allow it to be ‘any’.</p>

<p>To avoid a variable declaration that has not been assigned a value being assigned the type of ‘any’, when you declare the variable, specify a type:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">z</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">number</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">41</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">string</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// this will throw an error</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let z: number;</code> the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">: number;</code> is what is known as a type annotation. The type annotation for a variable that has been declared but is unassigned will tell TypeScript what it is ‘designed’ to hold, in the above example, a number. The point is that if you have variable declarations that are not assigned a value, it is best to annotate them with a type.</p>

<p>Q: In the TypeScript documentation, they usually have type annotation even when a variable is initialized with a value. Is this the recommended way, is it necessary?</p>

<p>A: It is recommended to do it that way if you are writing docs, because you are being very descriptive in documentation. If you have a variable with an initializer, you do not need to provide a type annotation. We’ll be very clear throughout the workshop the places where type information is absolutely necessary. This is a way of setting deliberate boundaries around pieces of code.</p>

<h3 id="arrays--tuples">Arrays &amp; Tuples</h3>

<p>Starting at line 51 in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./notes/1-basics.ts</code>, let’s look at typing arrays in TypeScript. Consider the following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">aa</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">number</span><span class="p">[]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[];</span>
<span class="nx">aa</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">33</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">aa</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">abc</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// error!</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The array has been defined to be an array of numbers, pushing a number to that array is fine, pushing anything other than a number is not fine. If you remove <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">: number[]</code> from the variable declaration, we get a new error. Try it, then hover over the ‘aa’, you should see the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">never</code> type next to the array brackets; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">never[]</code>. TypeScript has prevented us from using this declaration at all 😞, which may be a good thing because we probably do not want an array of anythings. For array declarations that start out as empty, you do need to have a type annotation; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">: number[]</code> for example. If you place a value in the array, TypeScript will be able to infer what type of value is allowed in the array.</p>

<p>Now on lines 64-69 we are looking at tuples (Mike says tup-els, I’ve heard toop-els as well for pronunciations). Either way you say it, tuples are just a special type of array that have a fixed length:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">bb</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">number</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">string</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">string</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">number</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="mi">123</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Fake Street</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Nowhere, USA</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="mi">10110</span>
<span class="p">];</span>

<span class="nx">bb</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">];</span> <span class="c1">// error bb[1] and bb[2] are set above to be type string</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>One issue in the code block above is that you can actually use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.push</code> and get around the typing that has been defined. In general, array methods are not type-safe. There is actually no way to safely ‘type’ <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.push</code>, it would require watching the type signature of the array and change the type check based on the state of the array. The only way to get a valid type check with tuples is to set everything at once which can then be checked as a whole.</p>

<p>Q: If you did want to have an array that can be either a number or a string, how would you go about doing that?</p>

<p>A: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(string | number)[]</code></p>

<p>When creating tuples, things of fixed length i.e. a pair of numbers in an array, you are always going to specify the type you want and in the format you want; i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const y: [number, number] = [1, 2];</code></p>

<h3 id="object-types--interfaces">Object Types &amp; Interfaces</h3>

<p>Object typing looks similar to object key/value pairs, but is instead key/type pairs. By default all object properties are mandatory. If you would like to make something in an object optional, you can use the optional operator (?) to do so. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let myObj: { key1: number; key2?: string };</code> If you want to re-use a type, you can create an ‘interface’ for it:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kr">interface</span> <span class="nx">Address</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">houseNum</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">number</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nx">streetName</span><span class="p">?:</span> <span class="nx">string</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">myThing</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">Address</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="na">houseNum</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">00</span> <span class="p">};</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We’ll cover interface more later.</p>

<h3 id="intersection--union-types">Intersection &amp; Union Types</h3>

<p>Intersection Types - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./notes/1-basics.ts</code> lines 120 - 141</p>

<p>At the section in the file listed above, there have been two types of interfaces created, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HasPhoneNumber</code> &amp; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HasEmail</code>. The interfaces share the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name</code> property, then have a phone or email property respectively. Lines 132 - 143 is going to ‘randomly’ initialize the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contactInfo</code> object where it will be set as either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HasEmail</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HasPhoneNumber</code> depending on the outcome of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Math.random()</code>. Once the function ‘sets up’ the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contactInfo</code> variable, only the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.name</code> property is accessible, because that is the only property that is guaranteed to be there.</p>

<p>Union Types - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./notes/1-basics.ts</code> lines 150 - 160</p>

<p>Union types use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> operator to define a variable who’s shape contains all of the properties of whatever is included between the objects declared. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let otherContactInfo: HasEmail &amp; HasPhoneNumber</code> would require <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">otherContactInfo</code> to have a name, phone, and email property. Unlike the Intersection type, Union guarantees that the result will have all of the properties and they are therefore all accessible.</p>

<h3 id="type-systems--object-shapes">Type Systems &amp; Object Shapes</h3>

<p>Type Systems come down to the idea of Type Equivalence. We’ve already seen this when looking at some of the error messages. In nominal type systems, Java and many others, type equivalence is determined based on whether an input to a function is an instance of a class/type named the same as its definition; i.e.:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">validateInputField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">input</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">HTMLInputElement</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c">&lt;!--</span>  <span class="o">--&gt;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">validateInputField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// the nominal type system will check whether 'x' can be regarded as 'HTMLInputElement'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Nominal Type Systems require your code to be set up in an Object Oriented way, where you have constructors and you are dealing primarily with instances of classes. JavaScript code is not necessarily written this way. TypeScript is a Structural Type System which only cares about the shape of an object. Shape? Yes, shape refers to the names of properties and types of their values. Not only is shape and keeping it consistent important to TypeScript, but in JavaScript, avoiding introducing new properties to objects, you have a better shot at JavaScript runtimes, like V8, being able to optimize your code.</p>

<p>TypeScript uses the terms, wider and narrower to describe a level of specificity. In order of widest to narrowest, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">any</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">any[]</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string[]</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[string, string, string]</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">["abc", "def", string]</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">never</code>. Wide is very general (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">any</code>) while narrow is extremely specific. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">never</code> is the narrowest level of specificity as it can literally hold no value.</p>

<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>

<p>You are now commanded to look at this file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./notes/2-function-basics.ts</code>.</p>

<p>Uncomment lines 6-11 (the entire <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sendEmail</code> function declaration) and hover over <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HasEmail</code>. If you are on a mac, you can ‘command + click’ <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HasEmail</code> and you will be taken to the interface definition for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HasEmail</code>. Here’s the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sendEmail</code> function definition:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">sendEmail</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">to</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">HasEmail</span><span class="p">):</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nl">recipient</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">string</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nl">body</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">string</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">recipient</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">`</span><span class="p">${</span><span class="nx">to</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="s2"> &lt;</span><span class="p">${</span><span class="nx">to</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">email</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="s2">&gt;`</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="c1">// Mike &lt;mike@example.com&gt;</span>
    <span class="na">body</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">You're pre-qualified for a loan!</span><span class="dl">"</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ recipient: string; body: string }</code> is the typing for the return object. Lines 13 - 21  show the arrow-function variant. Return types can also be inferred rather than explicitly defined (lines 23 - 38). If you uncomment those lines and hover over the function name; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getNameParts</code>, you will see the inferred return values: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">first: string; middle: string | undefined; last: string;</code> It is important to be intentional in what you are returning from functions and to make sure that the shape of the data your are returning is consistent. Rest parameters work as expected, but the type has to be array-like, because it will be consumed like an array.</p>

<h3 id="function-signature-overloading">Function Signature Overloading</h3>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>To understand what is meant by function signature overloading, first check out / uncomment lines (14-21, 53-62, 65, 68, 71). 14-21 are a function that is referenced in 53-62, 65, 68, and 71 are calling the function from lines 53-62. In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contactPeople</code> function, there are two OR conditions; “email”</td>
      <td>“phone” and then selecting an object type based on that. The immediate issue is that either “email” OR “phone” are allowed to have either object type, but each object type is actually specific to either of the methods; “email” to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HasEmail</code> and “phone” to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HasPhoneNumber</code>. So we need a way to define that “email” only allows <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HasEmail</code> and “phone” only allows <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HasPhoneNumber</code>. Uncomment lines 49 &amp; 50, then check line 71; there is now an error: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">No overload matches this call.</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Q: With the function signature overload defined, could you then remove the typing from within the actual function definition?</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A: Yes… but you’d then be removing any type of ‘type safety’, which would be bad for the purpose of maintaining the function. You might make the typing a bit more general if you needed to have more than 2 signature overload definitions; i.e. use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string</code> instead of “email”</td>
      <td>“phone”</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Q: So the overload signature is a documentation strategy?</p>

<p>A: No. It has documentation benefits but not only this. Overloading signatures also has type checking ramifications. More than providing tooltips, TypeScript is actually greenlighting certain styles of (function) invocation and forbidding anything else that does not fit.</p>

<h3 id="lexical-scope">Lexical Scope</h3>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./notes/2-function-basics.ts</code> lines 75-101</p>

<p>Lexical scope in JavaScript determines what is the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">this</code> when you invoke a function. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sendMessage</code> function has its <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">this</code> set to the union type of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HasEmail</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HasPhoneNumber</code>; an object with name, phone, and email properties. On line 87 an object <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c</code> is created that matches the union type. Lines 89-91 defines a function that will ‘destroy’ the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">this</code> binding, which can be seen on line 94, the conditions are not met and we see an error. Two ways to fix the binding (which we intentionally broke) are to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bind</code> the object to the function (line 97), or to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apply</code> the object to the function (line 102). You might not run into this very often, but if you do, now you know EVERYTHING you would ever need to know about functions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/functions.html#declaring-this-in-a-function">As of these notes, here’s the latest TypeScript documentation about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">this</code></a></p>

<h2 id="interfaces--type-aliases">Interfaces &amp; Type Aliases</h2>

<h3 id="type-aliases--extends">Type Aliases &amp; extends</h3>

<p>We’re now moving on to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./notes/3-interface-type-basics.ts</code>. Open it. Look at it. Bask in it’s commented-out glory.</p>

<p>Earlier there had been a question about the difference between interfaces and type aliases. Both interfaces and type aliases are ways of giving a structure a name that can be imported and exported from modules and referred to. The main benefit of this is having one, central place where a type is defined and used throughout a code base. Now we will look at both interfaces and aliases and compare / contrast them. We’ll look at Call, Construct, and Index Signatures. We’ll cover something called “Open interfaces” which is a way to augment types that you may import from another library. We’ll look at ‘Access modifier keywords’ which gives us control over who can see methods and instance data when it comes to classes. And finally, we’ll cover ‘Heritage clauses’ which is just another word for extends and implement (which is specific to TypeScript).</p>

<p>Starting with type aliases, they are a very simple concept. A type alias is literally giving a type a name. Any type that you can use with a variable you can also create a type alias for. Type aliases are defined and ‘figured out’ by the (TypeScript) compiler in terms of what values are allowed, in-line as the file is parsed. This (compiler) behavior prevents you from creating self-referential types (see lines 14 &amp; 15). We will look at this a bit more closely later.</p>

<p>We’ve already looked at interfaces, but let’s look at how interfaces can extend other interfaces, similar syntax to classes. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extends</code> is used for inheritance of like things; i.e. interfaces extend from interfaces as classes extend from classes. Here’s how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extend</code> looks:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="k">export</span> <span class="kr">interface</span> <span class="nx">HasInternationalPhoneNumber</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="nx">HasPhoneNumber</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">countryCode</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">string</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="call--construct-signatures">Call &amp; Construct Signatures</h3>

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./notes/3-interface-type-basics.ts</code> line 30.</p>

<p>We can use interface to describe a call signature:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kr">interface</span> <span class="nx">ContactMessenger1</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">contact</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">HasEmail</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nx">HasPhoneNumber</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">message</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">string</span><span class="p">):</span> <span class="k">void</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The parenthesis above are being used to describe a function. Interfaces can describe objects, functions, and we’ll also see how interfaces can describe arrays. We’re dealing exclusively with JavaScript values that extend from the JavaScript object type. There is no way to describe primitive JavaScript types with an interface (string or number). Type aliases, unlike interfaces, can handle the primitives and everything that an interface can handle. A benefit of defining interfaces is that you don’t need type annotations all over the place:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">emailer</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">ContactMessenger1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">_contact</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">_message</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="cm">/** ... */</span>
<span class="p">};</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The parameters <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_contact</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_message</code> will have their type defined by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ContactMessenger1</code>. Constructor signatures look very similar to (function) call signatures, with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new</code> keyword in front of the parenthesis:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kr">interface</span> <span class="nx">ContactConstructor</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">new</span> <span class="p">(...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">any</span><span class="p">[]):</span> <span class="nx">HasEmail</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nx">HasPhoneNumber</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="dictionary-objects--index-signatures">Dictionary Objects &amp; Index Signatures</h3>

<p>Starting at line 50 in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./notes/3-interface-type-basics.ts</code>.</p>

<span class="c1">// at most, a type may have one string and one number index signature</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="combining-interfaces">Combining Interfaces</h3>

<p>Index Signatures can be used in combination with other types AND they are considered to be ‘open’ meaning that any declarations of the same name will be merged. In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./notes/3-interface-type-basics.ts</code> lines 82-97, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">interface PhoneNumberDict</code> has been augmented in a way where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">home</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">office</code> numbers are required. This augmentation will be merged with the initial interface definition. The original interface definition for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PhoneNumberDict</code> is property agnostic in the sense that it only cares about the shape of the object and what the type of the key / value is. Augmenting that interface with additional typing allows us to ensure that we receive, and have type checked, an object with minimal key / value pairs (as defined by the interface), while also retaining the ability to type check any additional objects that get assigned to the object.</p>

<p>The last thing to point out about interfaces is that they are parsed like functions. Type aliases are sorted eagerly whereas interfaces are sorted lazily. Interfaces, like functions, get hoisted and can therefore be used before they are defined. Through combining types and interfaces, you do have the ability to create self-referential, or recursive, types. Here’s an example of that from the type alias section we looked at earlier:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">type</span> <span class="nx">NumVal</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="nx">NumVal</span><span class="p">[];</span>
<span class="kr">interface</span> <span class="nx">NumArr</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="nb">Array</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">NumVal</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Self-referential types are actually available in TypeScript as of version 3.7! (As of these notes, TypeScript was at version 4.3.5).</p>

<h3 id="type-tests">Type Tests</h3>

<p>In TypeScript, you can write tests for types. Microsoft has a library called ‘dtslint’ which uses ‘tslint’ which parses the linting error messages and compares them against special comments that you can leave in your types. This allows you to write test cases around things that are purely types.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/dtslint">dtslint repository</a></p>

<h2 id="classes">Classes</h2>

<h3 id="classes-1">Classes</h3>

<p>While you may be familiar with using classes in JavaScript, TypeScript adds some new concepts on top of what you’re used to (if you are familiar with classes in JavaScript…). The additions are, fields and access modifier keywords, which allow control over who can see member data and member functions on instances. Head on over to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./notes/4-class-basics.ts</code> file and we’ll dive right in. Let’s look at this class:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="k">export</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nx">Contact</span> <span class="kr">implements</span> <span class="nx">HasEmail</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nl">email</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">string</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="nl">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">string</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="kd">constructor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">string</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">email</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">string</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">email</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">email</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">implements</code> is one of the heritage clauses we heard about earlier; extends being the other. implements describes a class that aligns with a particular interface. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HasEmail</code> interface (which we also saw earlier) has defined both an email and a name property with the type string and when using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">implements</code>, we need to define, up-front, these same properties on a class that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">implements</code> them.</p>

<h3 id="access-modifiers--initialization">Access Modifiers &amp; Initialization</h3>

<p>Continuing with the code from above, you can see that it is fairly verbose, with email and name being defined 3 times 😞 TypeScript has a shortcut for this called ‘Parameter Properties’, and to understand the shortcut, we also need to understand access modifiers; public, protected, and private. Here are the access modifier definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>public - everyone 🎉</li>
  <li>protected - self and subclasses</li>
  <li>private - only self</li>
</ul>

<p>By utilizing the access modifiers, we can simplify the code from the previous section to look like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nx">ParamPropContact</span> <span class="kr">implements</span> <span class="nx">HasEmail</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">constructor</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="kr">public</span> <span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">string</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="kr">public</span> <span class="nx">email</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">string</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">no email</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// nothing needed</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public</code> access modifier inside of the constructor tells it to expect to receive a specified property as an argument as well as to place it on the instance of the object it constructs. If we were to change any (or both) of the access modifiers to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protected</code>, the resulting object would have whichever of the properties have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protected</code> unable to be read and it would also throw an error in TypeScript because the class would no longer conform to what the interface it is implementing.</p>

<p>Class fields can have initializers, as seen above <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string = "no email"</code>.</p>

<p>Q: Does TypeScript infer a type if given a default value (to an initializer)?</p>

<p>A: Yes… TypeScript will follow the same rules as we saw for variables, where if given an initial value, TypeScript will make a guess as to what the type should be.</p>

<p>One additional access modifier(ish) method that you can use is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readonly</code> which will throw an error if you try to write to it. This <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readonly</code> does nothing for us at build, in JavaScript, consumers of our code would have access to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readonly</code> properties, it is strictly a linting tool for authoring TypeScript.</p>

<h3 id="definite-assignment--lazy-initialization">Definite Assignment &amp; Lazy Initialization</h3>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nx">OtherContact</span> <span class="kr">implements</span> <span class="nx">HasEmail</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">HasPhoneNumber</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="c1">// () password must either be initialized like this, or have a default value</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">password</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">Math</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">round</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">Math</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">random</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="nx">e14</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">toString</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">32</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above code block, an initializer is being provided in another way. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Math.round...</code> could be moved up as a property initializer, but the point is that it could be initialized in either place. If you comment out the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">this.password...</code> line, TypeScript will throw an error message:</p>

<p>“Property ‘password’ has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.”</p>

<p>This is because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">password</code> is expected, based on its type, to have a value that is of type string. One way to get around this would be to set its type as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string | undefined</code>. In this  way, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">password</code> would be either a string or undefined. Another option, if we are 100% absolutely certain that we will have a condition met to then assign something to a property, is to use the definite assignment operator, which is an exclamation point <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!</code>, which would then look like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">private password!: string;</code>. We’re basically telling TypeScript that it does not need to worry about this having an assignment, we’ll take care of it, like for real for real.</p>

<p>But where else would we maybe want to use the definite assignment operator? Have you used any of these? React, Ember, Angular, Polymer, or Vue? Do you directly instantiate components? i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new ComponentName</code> then putting it directly in the DOM, or does the framework handle it for you? The framework handles it for you. There are often lifecycle hooks where you might be setting things up, setting up properties. In an early lifecycle hook, you might take care of putting a property such as password in place. It would be in this case, of using a framework, where you know that a property will be there, TypeScript is angry, but you want to let TypeScript know that it is going to be ok; the property that you are worried about will be there! Use the definite assignment initializer.</p>

<p>The other option is to ‘lazily’ create the password like so:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nx">OtherContact</span> <span class="kr">implements</span> <span class="nx">HasEmail</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">HasPhoneNumber</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<h3 id="abstract-classes">Abstract Classes</h3>

<p>Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly, they just serve as base classes. Abstract classes can have implementations.</p>

<h2 id="converting-to-typescript">Converting to TypeScript</h2>

<h3 id="converting-to-typescript-1">Converting to TypeScript</h3>

<p>Let’s step outside of the world of code for a moment and get into a delicious recipe: “How to convert JavaScript to TypeScript” 🤔 never mind… that does not sound very tasty. One of the great things about TypeScript is that it can inter-operate with JavaScript very easily, you can have JS and TS modules side-by-side. We should not treat a code base transition from JavaScript to TypeScript as the same kind of change that would result from changing from one programming language to something totally unrelated. i.e. rewriting something from Ruby to Rust. We are going to walk through a step-by-step process so that this change can be made incrementally on a few files at a time. Before we talk about what to do, lets look at what NOT to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Functional changes at the same time - i.e. don’t change from checking whether a value is truthy or not to a typeof check</li>
  <li>Attempt with low test coverage - you need to be able to confirm whether the code still works the way you want it to work</li>
  <li>Let perfect be the enemy of good - don’t try to type things too strongly too early on</li>
  <li>Forget to add tests for types - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dtslint</code> is your friend here</li>
  <li>Publish types for consumer use while they are in a weak state - wait until you are completely happy with your types before publishing them</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="compiling-in-loose-mode">Compiling in “loose mode”</h3>

<p>Step one of the “How to convert JavaScript to TypeScript” recipe is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start with tests passing</li>
  <li>Rename all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.js</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ts</code> allowing implicit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">any</code> - for whenever the TypeScript compiler is unable to infer any of the types; i.e. function arguments might be primary culprits here</li>
  <li>Fix only the things that are not type-checking or causing compile errors - JavaScript classes are a common culprit here, because in TypeScript you have to state the fields and their types</li>
  <li>Be careful to avoid changing behavior</li>
  <li>Get tests passing again</li>
</ul>

<p>Submit PR.</p>

<h3 id="making-anys-explicit">Making Anys Explicit</h3>

<p>Step two of the “How to convert JavaScript to TypeScript” recipe is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start with tests passing</li>
  <li>Ban implicit any (“noImplicitAny”: true,) - this will cause TypeScript to throw an error whenever is unable to infer the type of something, instead of falling back to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">any</code></li>
  <li>Where possible, provide a specific and appropriate type
    <ul>
      <li>Import types for dependencies from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DefinitelyTyped</code> - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DefinitelyTyped</code> is an open source project that provides ambient type information for your project’s dependencies</li>
      <li>otherwise explicit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">any</code> - via type annotation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Get tests passing again</li>
</ul>

<p>Submit PR.</p>

<h3 id="strict-mode">Strict Mode</h3>

<p>Step three of the “How to convert JavaScript to TypeScript” recipe is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Incrementally, in small chunks…</li>
  <li>Enable strict mode: 
  {
    …
    “strictNullChecks”: true, // the only value that can be null is null
    “strict”: true, // strictness settings
    “strictFunctionTypes”: true, // validates arguments and return callback types
    “strictBindCallApply”: true // makes sure that the arguments passed to bind call and apply all type check appropriately
    …
  }</li>
  <li>Replace explicit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">any</code>(s) with more appropriate types</li>
  <li>Try to avoid unsafe casts - avoid using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as</code> keyword</li>
</ul>

<p>Q: What are the benefits of moving an existing code base over to TypeScript?</p>

<p>A: All of the benefits that you would get if you started out using TypeScript from the genesis of your project.</p>

<p>Q: But, for the amount of effort, is it REALLY worth it?</p>

<p>A: It depends, case-by-case. Small JavaScript modules that only do one thing? Probably not much value. You can tell TypeScript to regard entire modules as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">any</code>, but this is losing the value of types.</p>

<h3 id="address-book-exercise">Address Book Exercise</h3>

<p>Now that we have completed the overview of the “How to convert JavaScript to TypeScript” recipe, let’s put that into practice by actually converting a piece of JavaScript code into TypeScript. There is an example in the project repository: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./challenges/address-book/src/index.js</code>. I’ll drop the code here as well, because it is walked-through so we can understand the places where we might need to think about type information.</p>

<p>The first of our 3 step recipe is to rename the file from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">...js</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">...ts</code> and setting up the TypeScript compiler in a very loose mode to get everything to pass. But step 0 (of course he hid a step from us) is to get the tests to pass before AND after we are done. In the console / terminal, switch into the directory that the exercise file is in: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd challenges/address-book</code> (if you were still at the root directory of the repository…), then run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yarn test</code>. All tests pass, but now the trick is to change the file extension from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.js</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.ts</code> and try to get the tests to pass AND go through the 2 other steps after that to complete the recipe 😞</p>
