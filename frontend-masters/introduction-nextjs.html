<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>

<p>The instructor, Scott Moss, talks about the various ways he uses Next.js from static websites to full blown full stack applications and APIs. This workshop will be a ‘follow along’ type of format. You do not have to follow along, but you are encouraged to do so. The course website (link above) will be used as a reference for everything that is going to be covered in this workshop. This workshop, as named, will be an introduction to Next.js. There will be some advanced topics touched on, but they are not the focus of this workshop.</p>

<p>There are tons of great resources available on Next.js, this is Scott’s take on what we need to know. This workshop is perfect for people who know some React. But if you do not know React, i.e. maybe you know another framework or at least some web development, you should be fine. But if you would like to learn some React, you can check my notes about that, or go to Frontend Masters and directly take the workshop(s). We will also be covering how to use JAMstack with Next.js.</p>

<p>The goal of this workshop is to get you to the point that you can make a Next.js app and have a great foundation for more advanced topics.</p>

<h3 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h3>

<p>As mentioned, the format of this course is to follow along. There is also a repository which is linked at the top of these notes. <a href="https://github.com/Hendrixer/nextjs-course-app/tree/master/">Link to Course Repository</a> The repository is structured with a branch for every major checkpoint of this workshop, so if you missed something or want to see how the outcome of a particular section should look, you can check out the different branches as needed, but we will be starting from scratch.</p>

<p>As for what we will be building, we will be building a SaaS note taking application. It is very simple, so that we can focus on the Next.js specifics, and not build something too complicated or feature-rich that would get in the way of focusing on Next.js itself.</p>

<p>What do we need to participate with this workshop?</p>

<p>Node.js &gt;= 10 - it is recommended to use nvm (node version manager) or n
npm or yarn</p>

<p>What are we going to learn?</p>

<p>Next.js? Yes, but what specifically? Well… What is Next.js, how does it compare to React, when to use Next.js, getting started, creating pages and components, SEO, static and dynamic routing, navigation, styling, API routes, fetching data, pre-rendering, deployment, JAMstack.</p>

<h3 id="nextjs-overview">Next.js Overview</h3>

<p>In order to understand Next.js, it is important to understand some of its bigger dependencies, the biggest of which is React. React is not exactly a framework, but more of a view library. You can’t really build a full, feature-rich application with React alone. You will have to install a few more things; a router, you have to figure out how to do styling, you’ll have to figure out a build system, and so on. There are a lot of decisions that need to be made if you are using only React. Next.js on the other hand, is a framework, or an app-ready framework. Next.js is a full stack framework, no only allowing you to build frontend applications, but it also helps you build out APIs, and it uses React as its view library.</p>

<p>Next.js is essentially a bunch of conventions and opinions built on top of the React ‘framework’. Vercel, the creators of Next.js, basically took all of their opinions and a lot of the things that the (React?) community has been doing over the years and decided that Next.js was basically the way that everyone is going to build things anyway, hence they created a new framework, AKA Next.js. Some of the things that you get for ‘free’ with Next.js:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dev build system - i.e. Webpack</li>
  <li>Production build system</li>
  <li>Pre-rendering
    <ul>
      <li>SSR - Server Side Rendering</li>
      <li>Build Time</li>
      <li>Static</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Routing</li>
  <li>API routes</li>
</ul>

<p>Wonderful! What about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CRA</code> (create-react-app)? Create React App does a lot of the above things and has a lot of opinions baked-in to it, but it is basically boilerplate, with a build system, but as mentioned you still have to make a lot of decisions.</p>

<p>And what about Gatsby? Gatsby is more similar to Next.js, but there are some differences in their features and opinions. Gatsby will serve you well if you know GraphQL, it can not create API routes or do server-side rendering. Gatsby also has image optimization out of the box, which Next.js does not have.</p>

<p>When should you use Next.js? Are you only making a single page application? Use Create React App. Do you need a static site, like a blog, that is also a SPA? Use Next.js (or Gatsby). Need server-side rendering, an API, and all the other things? Use Next.js.</p>

<p>Q: Can you use databases with Next.js?</p>

<p>A: Yes, you can.</p>

<h3 id="getting-started-with-nextjs">Getting Started with Next.js</h3>

<p>Drop this in to your terminal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone https://github.com/Hendrixer/nextjs-course-app.git &amp; git checkout start</code>. This will put us at a basic starting point, but you can also start from scratch with your own repository. If you were to start from scratch, you could run either of the following commands:</p>

<p>With npm: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npx create-next-app</code></p>

<p>With yarn: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yarn create-next-app</code></p>

<p>Either of the commands above will run an install of the CLI and scaffold a next app for you, but we are going to do it a different way altogether…</p>

<p>With npm: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm i next react react-dom --save</code></p>

<p>With yarn: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yarn add next react react-dom</code></p>

<p>Either of those commands will add/install the dependencies that we need. Then in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> file, we need to add some scripts:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">scripts</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">dev</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">next</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">build</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">next build</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">start</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">next start</span><span class="dl">"</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>What are the scripts doing? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dev</code> will run the Next.js application in development mode using Hot Module Reloading. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">build</code> will build command which gets the application ready for production. And <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start</code> will start a build. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">build</code>  and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start</code> are only really for production.</p>

<p>Note: Next.js is a full-stack framework and needs to be hosted on a platform that supports Node.js.</p>

<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>

<h3 id="routing-with-pages-in-nextjs">Routing with Pages in Next.js</h3>

<p>When you create a ‘vanilla’ React app, you have to decide which routing library and version you want to use, then install it, set it up. With Next.js, routing is already handled for you and the conventions have been created for you as well. To get started with routing in Next.js, open up your project in your code editor (use VSCode!). In the root of your project, create a folder named ‘pages’. Inside of that new folder, make a new file, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.jsx</code>. Then make a quick React component, the example given is:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">React</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">react</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">Page</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">div</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">Index</span> <span class="nx">Page</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/div</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>
<span class="k">export</span> <span class="k">default</span> <span class="nx">Page</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Once you have the above set up, you can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm run dev</code> to spin up your app. Now if you point your browser to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost:3000</code> you should see the index page that we just created. All we had to do was create a folder and a file and the routing is handled for us! Admittedly not super exciting, but what if we wanted to create nested OR dynamic routes, i.e. a route that is based on a specific parameter like a username? No problem. Since we are making a note taking app, we will need a route for all notes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/notes</code> and a route for a single note <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/notes/:id</code>.</p>

<p>In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pages</code> folder, add a new folder, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notes</code> and in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notes</code> folder add a new file, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.jsx</code>. In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.jsx</code> file add this code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">React</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">react</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">Page</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">div</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">Notes</span> <span class="nx">index</span> <span class="nx">path</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/div</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>
<span class="k">export</span> <span class="k">default</span> <span class="nx">Page</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now to make the dynamic route for a single note, the file naming syntax looks like this: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[id].jsx</code>. The brackets surrounding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id</code> will tell Next.js that a parameter will be passed in when accessing this page, in our case and id. Drop this code into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[id].jsx</code>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">React</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">react</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">Page</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">div</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">Note</span> <span class="nx">page</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/div</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>
<span class="k">export</span> <span class="k">default</span> <span class="nx">Page</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now point your browser to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost:3000/notes</code> and you can see the notes page we created, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost:3000/notes/whateveryouwanttoputhere</code> and you should see the page that says ‘Note page’. If you try to access a nested route of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notes/id/...</code>, i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost:3000/notes/whateveryouwanttoputhere/anotherpage</code>, you should see a 404 error page. On any non-error page, you might notice that there is a lightening bolt there, if you hover over it, you will see that it says ‘Prerendered Page’. This is letting us know that the page has been… prerendered. You can click on that message and be taken to the Next.js documentation and learn more about what that means, but we will also cover it later.</p>

<h3 id="dynamic-route-parameters-in-nextjs">Dynamic Route Parameters in Next.js</h3>

<p>The dynamic route we created <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[id].jsx</code> is nice, but how does it work and how can we use it? Well, to start, we’ll have to import the Next.js router module <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">useRouter</code>. At the top of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[id].jsx</code> add the following <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">impoort</code> statement:</p>

<p>`import { useRouter } from ‘next/router’</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">useRouter</code> is a React hook, most React hooks start with the ‘use’ keyword. We’ll update the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[id].jsx</code> code in a moment, but are going to touch on the difference between a functional and  class-based component. In a functional component, the whole component is the render function, whereas with a class component, you manually have to create a render function and anything outside of that render function is not a part of it.</p>

<p>Update <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[id].jsx</code> like so:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">React</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">react</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">import</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">useRouter</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">next/router</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">Page</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">router</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">useRouter</span><span class="p">();</span>

  <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">id</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">router</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">query</span><span class="p">;</span>

  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">h1</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
      <span class="nx">Note</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/h1</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>  <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">export</span> <span class="k">default</span> <span class="nx">Page</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, if you return to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost:3000/notes/1</code>, you should see an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;h1&gt;</code> element rendered on the page with ‘Note 1’ displayed.</p>

<h3 id="catch-all-routes">Catch-All Routes</h3>

<p>We had used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">router.query</code> to grab the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id</code> property for a dynamic route in the last section. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">router.query</code> has a lot of other properties and even gives you the ability to create catch-all routes. You might use this if you have a nested folder inside of a nested folder inside of a nested folder. Catch-all routes are similar to a glob pattern <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">path/folder/**</code> where the asterisks denote that everything after the last specified directory (folder in this example) is included. In Next.js, we can specify a catch-all route with the following file naming syntax: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[...params].jsx</code> We can now update our component to use a catch-all route, but let’s try to think of why we would even ever use this 🤔</p>

<p>Maybe all of your pages within a nested directory need the same rendering? This would be a good use case. There is another type of catch-all route, the optional catch-all route. The optional catch-all route will also include its parent, and the syntax for an optional catch-all route is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[...params]].jsx</code> (notice the 2 sets of brackets, also FYI, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">params</code> name can be whatever you want). Again, docs and wikis might be great use cases for this approach.</p>

<p>We’ve learned a bit about pages, but what about things that are not pages? Non-pages! When it comes to components, Next.js doesn’t have any opinions or conventions. The community-convention is to create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/src/componets</code> folder to house components. This is similar to how people generally structure their React applications. And once you have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/src/</code> directory, you can throw your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pages</code> directory in there as well, to keep your project cleaner, but make sure that you do not also have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pages</code> directory in the root of your project because that would take precedence over the one in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/src/</code>.</p>

<h3 id="page-navigation-with-the-link-component">Page Navigation with the Link Component</h3>

<p>There’s some pages in our app now, but navigating through the address bar in the browser is probably not the best for usability. Let’s add a link component to our app. Next.js ‘gives’ us a link component which allows us to route between pages. The link component is strictly for client-side routing, if you are linking to another site, then you should use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;a&gt;</code> tag instead. Open up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pages/index.jsx</code> and update it to use the link component:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">React</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">react</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p>Your main app page will now have a link on it! How about those dynamic routes though? How can we link to them? Open up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pages/notes/index.jsx</code> and update that page code to this:</p>

<h3 id="routing-and-navigation-qa">Routing and Navigation Q&amp;A</h3>

<p>Q: Is there a reason that we have to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as</code> on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;Link&gt;</code> component? Can we use it without?</p>

<p>A: If we left <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as</code> off of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;Link&gt;</code> component, how would Next.js know what the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[id]</code> is? It wouldn’t. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as</code> is only required for dynamic routes.</p>

<p>Q: Do all routes have to be declared from the root of the pages folder?</p>

<p>A: Yes, links are relative to the pages folder.</p>

<p>Q: Are there any SEO considerations when using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;Link&gt;</code>?</p>

<p>A: No more than if you were using any other client-side router. Client-side routing usually proxies the HTML5 pushState experience. Google now crawls JavaScript for page indexing, but Twitter and Facebook do not, so with any client-side routing, you may run into issues.</p>

<h3 id="adding-css--modules">Adding CSS &amp; Modules</h3>

<p>Moving on to our instructors favorite thing, styling! <a href="https://hendrixer.github.io/nextjs-course/styling">Here’s the link to that section of the course website</a>. Scott enjoys CSS and making things look picture perfect. If you have any familiarity with React, you may also be aware that there are a number of different ways to work with CSS and how to style things. So Next.js made a decision(s) for us. In Next.js there are two basic types of styling: global and component.</p>

<p>The only way to get global styling into your Next.js application is through the use of a special page called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pages/_app.jsx</code> (or wherever you’ve placed your pages folder). <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_app.jsx</code> allows us to ‘hijack’ the entry point to our Next.js application. This file is created for us by default by Next.js and does not need to be created unless we want to do some global styling. Go ahead and make an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_app.jsx</code> file in the pages folder root, and add this to it:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">React</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">react</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">export</span> <span class="k">default</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">App</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">Component</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">pageProps</span> <span class="p">})</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">Component</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">...</span><span class="nx">pageProps</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="sr">/</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span><span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Straight away, this does nothing different than what Next.js does out of the box, but with this file we are now able to add global styling. In the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_app.jsx</code> file you can now import styles: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import 'directoryname/nameofcssfile.css</code>. And if you try to import a CSS file in to any other page, you will get an error, but you can import CSS as a module in files other than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_app.jsx</code>. We’ll look at that shortly. The reason Next.js has you use global styling in this way has to do with the bundling of the styles and how global styles are treated to make sure they are loaded in properly. Anyway, try to avoid using global CSS.</p>

<p>What we are going to be using is Next.js’ support for CSS modules. The way CSS modules work is that for each import of CSS, even if it is the same CSS, it will get scoped to the component with a unique name before each class so that the CSS styling is unique to each import. This happens at build time. You can use CSS modules anywhere. To create a CSS module, all you have to do is add module to the filename: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">styles.module.css</code>. Now you can import that CSS as a module everywhere. The only other thing to know right now is that CSS modules need class names, you are not allowed to target ‘pure’ elements (basically any HTML element; body, div, a, etc…). The reason being that the way the classnames get scoped, they have to be a class and not an element.</p>

<h3 id="adding-theme-ui">Adding Theme UI</h3>

<p>Scott is now going to speak about his approach to working with CSS in React / Next.js, starting with the fact that he likes to use <a href="https://theme-ui.com/">Theme UI</a>. From the Theme UI docs: “Theme UI is a library for creating themeable user interfaces based on constraint-based design principles.”. Basically, you can create an object that represents a theme and use that for all of your components. Let’s get Theme UI installed:</p>

<p>With npm: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm i theme-ui @theme-ui/presets --save</code></p>

<p>With yarn: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yarn add theme-ui @theme-ui/presets</code></p>

<p>Then, in the root directory of your project, create a theme file: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">theme.js</code>. And in your theme file, drop in the following code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="k">import</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">roboto</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">@theme-ui/presets</span><span class="dl">'</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">theme</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="na">containers</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>

      <span class="na">p</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="na">page</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="na">width</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">100%</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="na">maxWidth</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">960px</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="na">m</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="na">mx</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">auto</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="na">styles</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="p">...</span><span class="nx">roboto</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">styles</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="k">export</span> <span class="k">default</span> <span class="nx">theme</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But what is all that stuff?! First, we’re importing a preset which is a starting point for our theme. For the theme object, there is a specific set of properties that should be there and immediately inside of that object, we are spreading out the ‘roboto’ preset. Then at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">containers</code>, the nested objects <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">card</code> &amp; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page</code> are basically CSS components (called variants in Theme UI) that can be added to any component that you want. You can use theme-based values for properties; like ‘muted’, that is not a color in CSS, but is defined in the ‘roboto’ theme preset. And then the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">styles</code> object will be used to style things globally. To really see what is happening with the theme and what it is, add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">console.log</code> statement in the file: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">console.log(theme)</code> then add it to the (entire) site, in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_app.jsx</code>, update that file code to:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">React</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">react</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">ThemeProvider</span> <span class="nx">theme</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">theme</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

</span>    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/ThemeProvider</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span>  <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you’ve updated all the things, you should be able to reload the page and see that the fonts and colors have changed. If you are having an issue, try restarting the app: In the terminal; press ctrl + c to terminate the process, hit the up arrow to select the last command, press enter to restart. You can also check the console in the browser to see the theme object. Theme UI also handles responsive design very well, another great reason to use it.

<h3 id="styling-with-theme-ui">Styling with Theme UI</h3>

<p>You may have noticed quite a few different things going on if you followed the last bit above where I directed you to the course website:</p>

<ul>
  <li>`/** @jsx jsx */</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import { jsx } from 'theme-ui'</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sx=...</code></li>
</ul>

<p>What are those things and why?!</p>

<p>Side note: Adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/** @jsx jsx */</code> resulted in an error, so I also had to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/** @jsxRuntime classic */</code> to get this working properly.</p>

<p>This bit: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/** @jsx jsx */</code>, is called JavaScript pragma which is a directive to tell the compiler, in the case of Next.js, the compiler is Babel, that when it compiles jsx we want it to use a specific tool (jsx from theme-ui) and not React’s jsx. Have you ever noticed that in every jsx file you are always importing React? This is for the compiler to be able to know how to compile jsx, and that information comes from React.</p>

<p>The Theme UI jsx compiler is what gives us the ability to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sx</code> property on the HTML elements in our components. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sx</code> property is essentially inline styles, the difference being that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sx</code> property will not actually be an inline style that you can inspect in the browser, but the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sx</code> properties will be transformed into CSS and added the the head of the document, with class names that are scoped to the elements. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sx</code> also gives you the ability to interact with / use theme variables, and is TypeScript, so you get a lot of useful and informative tooltips. None of this is specific to Next.js, this is all specific to Theme UI.</p>

<p>Q: Theme UI vs Tailwind?</p>

<p>A: Theme UI is associated with Gatsby, and Theme UI is the next iteration of Tailwind?</p>

<p>Q: Is this (Theme UI) built on top of Emotion? Can you use the styled interface that Emotion has?</p>

<p>A: Yep, you just have to import it like you normally would.</p>

<p>Right out of the box, Next.js handles a lot of things for us, but if you want to change anything or opt-in or opt-out of various things, create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">next-config.js</code> file in the root directory of your project. You have 2 options for the configuration export, an object or a function. The object format looks like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">module</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">exports</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="na">webpack</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// webpack config properties</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="na">env</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">MY_ENV_VAR</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">process</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">env</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">SECRET</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>…and the function format:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">PHASE_PRODUCTION_SERVER</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">next/constants</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">BundleAnalyzerPlugin</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">webpack-bundle-analyzer</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">BundleAnalyzerPlugin</span>

<span class="nx">module</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">exports</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">phase</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">defaultConfig</span> <span class="p">})</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">phase</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="nx">PHASE_PRODUCTION_SERVER</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="p">...</span><span class="nx">defaultConfig</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="na">webpack</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="na">plugins</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">BundleAnalyzerPlugin</span><span class="p">()]</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">defaultConfig</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the function example above, we’ve set a condition to check the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">phase</code> value, which if the condition is met will run. Also, we have to use commonJS require instead of import statements. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/shared/lib/constants.ts">other available phases here</a>.</p>

<p>Q: Do you have o modify the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">defaultConfig</code>?</p>

<p>A: I usually don’t modify arguments, so it is safest to spread over the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">defaultConfig</code> and then add your changes.</p>

<h3 id="plugins">Plugins</h3>

<p>The Next.js config file gives us the ability to do some powerful stuff with plugins, which are basically extended configurations. The plugin naming convention is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">withPluginName</code> and using a plugin looks something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="c1">// in next.config.js</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">config</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{};</span> <span class="c1">// config options</span>
<span class="nx">module</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">exports</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">withPluginName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">config</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">// some plugins have arguments, those would appear first, followed by the config object; i.e. withPluginName(argument, config)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s add a plugin that allows us to add environment variables to out Next.js app! Start by making a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.env</code> file in the root of your application. Now, let’s install a couple of dependencies:</p>

<p>With npm: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm i next-env dotenv-load --dev</code></p>

<p>With yarn: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yarn add next-env dotenv-load --dev</code></p>

<p>Once those dependencies are installed, add the following to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">next.config.js</code> file:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">nextEnv</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">next-env</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">dotenvLoad</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">dotenv-load</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">dotenvLoad</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">withNextEnv</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">nextEnv</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nx">module</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">exports</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">withNextEnv</span><span class="p">();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.env</code> file at the root of your application (create the file if needed):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">HELP_APP_URL</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nx">https</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="c1">//google.com</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that we have the ability to use environment variables and have one set up, let’s use it in the nav component:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="c1">//...</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">a</span> <span class="nx">sx</span><span class="o">=</span>
  <span class="nx">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">process</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">env</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">HELP_APP_URL</span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nx">Help</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/a</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span><span class="c1">//...</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Note: I could not get this section to work 😞</p>

<h3 id="typescript-with-nextjs">Typescript with Next.js</h3>

<p>If you want to use TypeScript with Next.js, all you have to do is make a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsconfig.json</code> file and install the things: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm install typescript @types/react --dev</code>. Then start your app again and Next.js should auto-populate your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tsconfig.json</code> file (also did not work for me).</p>
