<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>

<p>This workshop will cover a ‘style’ of functional programming that the instructor, Kyle Simpson, has developed; Functional-Light JS. You can also read Kyle’s book of the same name <a href="https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS">here</a>. ‘Light’ is not intended to allude to the depth or level of difficulty of this workshop, rather ‘Light’ refers to the workshops’ intention to not weigh you down with terminology or mathematic notation. This workshop will take a ‘bottom-up’ approach to Functional Programming in JavaScript, an approach that does not make the assumption that you have a background in mathematics or knowledge of specific terminology.</p>

<h3 id="why-functional-programming">Why Functional Programming</h3>

<p>One of the biggest reasons to learn functional programming is because it is, in Kyle’s opinion, impossible to write functional programming in isolation. Meaning that if you bring these concepts back to work and write some code in a functional programming style, submit a pull request, that it is then somehow magically going to now be the way that your team writes code. Nope… It is important to learn functional programming so that you can convince others of its importance.</p>

<p>Functional programming is not imperative, it is declarative. An imperative approach is one that is primarily focused on how to do something; i.e. add a bunch of numbers from an array and return the result, would probably lead you to having an accumulator variable and a for loop to loop over the array and add each number in the array to the accumulator variable. But this is an imperative approach because a future reader of your code would have to read all of your code to understand what is happening. This is <em>fine</em>. but the being that benefits most from imperative code is the computer, not the human. A declarative approach focuses on the what, the outcome; which should, by its very nature, make your code inherently more obvious as to what its purpose is and what it does. Functional programming != declarative, but it is <strong>more</strong> declarative than it is imperative.</p>

<h3 id="functional-programming-journey">Functional Programming Journey</h3>

<p>The instructor, and maybe you or myself?, admits to starting off with somewhat readable but imperative (non-functional) code which evolved to less readable but closer to declarative code, finally ending up at highly readable and functional code. He points out that in the middle of that journey is where most people ‘drop-off’ from continuing to pursue functional programming. The ‘pit of despair’ is that point when most people ‘drop-off’ from continuing to pursue functional programming and the instructor admits he hit this point, but stresses the importance of continuing on, of continuing to pursue ones understanding of functional programming. Small wins will turn into bigger wins will turn into something that is greater than no understanding whatsoever of functional programming. The important thing is to keep at it!</p>

<p>No one can remove the fact that functional programming is difficult, but an aim of this course is to make it approachable and more manageable. It will be important for you to find comfort in the unfamiliar and keep the faith when your code becomes less readable on your functional programming journey, when you learn a new concept or approach this is how it will be at first, but it is important to trust the process of learning and know that at some point you will understand what you are doing and your code will become more readable.</p>

<h3 id="code-is-provable">Code is Provable</h3>

<p>Functional programming is based on mathematical principles. It is likely that we’ve all written code that did not pass a test and then we fumble through trying to figure out how to get whatever we’re working on to pass the test. But what would it be like if when you wrote some code that you were then going to test that you were 100% certain of the outcome? Would that fact make you a more effective programmer? Would you have more confidence? Would you drop your sense of being an imposter?! The set of techniques associated with functional programming are not just a nicely designed API, they <em>are</em> about using mathematical principles, in a mathematically sound way, that just so happens to look like programming and happens to let us solve programming problems. An overarching goal [of functional programming] is to reduce the cognitive overhead, to rely on mathematical principles, to produce code that requires less reading; code that is easier to understand, which frees us up to focus on the important pieces with far less guesswork.</p>

<h3 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Functions - because… in functional programming it is important to understand what a function is <strong>and</strong> what a function is <em>is</em> probably not what you think it is.</li>
  <li>Closure - you do not understand the entirety of functional programming if you do not understand closure. We will understand it.</li>
  <li>Composition - the way that data flows and is mapped through applications.</li>
  <li>Immutability - how we manage the changes to values and state over time. Management of state change is one of the fundamentals of almost all programming.</li>
  <li>Recursion - an incredibly useful too, especially in functional programming.</li>
  <li>Lists / Data Structures - map, filter, reduce… this is what everybody calls functional programming, but with the other sections, these functions are only part of functional programming, not the entirety of what it is.</li>
  <li>Async - the act of applying functional principles over time… aka asynchronous functional programming.</li>
  <li>FP Libraries - a look at some of the libraries available in the wild to use in projects that will help you get the most out of functional programming.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="function-purity">Function Purity</h2>

<h3 id="functions-vs-procedures">Functions vs Procedures</h3>

<p>What is a function? Let’s start with this inflammatory statement: “Functional programming is not all about the function keyword”. Consider the following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addNumbers</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">w</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">z</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">w</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">total</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">extraNumbers</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">addNumbers</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">40</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">extraNumbers</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// 42</span>
<span class="nx">extraNumbers</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// 62</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addNumbers</code> a function? What about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extraNumbers</code>? Are either of them functions? If they are not functions, why not?</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addNumbers</code> clearly takes some inputs (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x, y, z, w</code>) and it clearly does something with those inputs, so it is at least kind of like a function, right? Nope. The bar for being a function is a bit higher than that. So… what is it then? The best term that we could use to describe <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addNumbers</code> is that it is a ‘procedure’. A procedure is a collection of operations, a collection of things that you need to do in a program. Just because it uses the function keyword does not make it a function. Procedures can take inputs, they can return outputs, they can print to the console, they can be called multiple times. There are a lot of benefits to procedures, but this course is not about procedural programming (yes, its a thing).</p>

<p>Wonderful, but… what is a function? To start, a function not only has to take some input, it also has to return some output. Not just print something to the console, if it does not have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> keyword, it is most definitely not a function! So any ‘function’ that does not have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> keyword is a procedure and a function is more than what we’ve covered so far, we will expand on what a function <strong>is</strong> as we move through this workshop. Oooook, so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addNumbers</code> isn’t a function, it’s a procedure. What about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extraNumbers</code>? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extraNumbers</code> <strong>has</strong> a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> keyword! <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extraNumbers</code> is function? 😞 No.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extraNumbers</code> is not a function, because; expanding on the definition of what a function <strong>is</strong>, a function can only call other functions. Functions cannot call procedures (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addNumbers</code>), if they do, they themselves become procedures. Number one in functional programming is that you can’t do functional programming with a thing that is not a function; it has to be a function for you to take advantage of functional principles. So, neither <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addNumbers</code> nor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extraNumbers</code> qualify as functions because they both violate what we have so far learned about what a function is. They are procedures.</p>

<p>How about this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">tuple</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">tuple</span><span class="p">(...[</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">]);</span>

<span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// 6</span>
<span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// 9</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In JavaScript, a tuple is basically two values in an array. The function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tuple</code> has inputs, uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return</code> keyword to return outputs, it is a function?</p>

<h3 id="function-naming-semantics">Function Naming Semantics</h3>

<p>Long story short, yes, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tuple</code> was a function. But if you took that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tuple</code> function and it required the inputs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code>, but instead of returning those as outputs returned the number 40, would it still be a function? Not really. To better understand what makes a function a function, lets look at some maths:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>f(x) = 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above might look familiar from some math you may have learned in (not college) school and, unless you were using a graphing calculator, you may recall not really understanding that math in any real concrete sense. The reality of the math above is that you are taking an input value, x, putting it into a function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>. The output value will be the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> coordinate, when you combine <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code>, you will see a ‘u’ shape on a graph! Uh huh… But what is a function? A function is a relationship between the input and the output. If you were to write the above maths as a JavaScript function, it might look something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">parabola</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nb">Math</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">pow</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In functional programming, it matters that there is an obvious relationship between the input and output of a function. Again, a function is the semantic relationship between input and computed output. Here’s another example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">shippingRate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">size</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">weight</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">speed</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="nx">size</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">weight</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">speed</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="side-effects">Side Effects</h3>

<p>In functional programming there should not be any side effects in functions. But what is meant by side effects? Indirect inputs or outputs. Like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">shippingRate</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">rate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="nx">size</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">weight</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">speed</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">rate</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">size</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">weight</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">speed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">shippingRate</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nx">rate</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// 57</span>

<span class="nx">size</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">speed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="nx">shippingRate</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="nx">rate</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// 42</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above code has no direct relationship between the input and output values, and therefore is not considered a function. If however, we made some changes and made the code look like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">shippingRate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">size</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">weight</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">speed</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="nx">size</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">weight</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">speed</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p>Now in the above code, the (direct) relationship between the input and output values has been created and this qualifies as a function? Yes! The important thing to consider when talking about whether or not a function is a function is to look at where was the function called, which needs to avoid creating or using side effects. But w hat really are the side effects that we need to be concerned about?</p>

<ul>
  <li>I/O (console, files, etc) - Any logs or something dealing with files are considered side effects on the system</li>
  <li>Database Storage</li>
  <li>Network Calls</li>
  <li>Reading from / Writing to the DOM</li>
  <li>Timestamps</li>
  <li>Generating a Random Number</li>
  <li>CPU Heat? - Any program will cause a CPU to compute which in turn will cause it to generate heat which is a side effect</li>
  <li>CPU Time Delay</li>
</ul>

<p>Not only is it impractical to avoid all side effects, but it is theoretically impossible to avoid all side effects. So really, what is meant when it is suggested to avoid side effects is to minimize them. A program with no side effects would be no different than if the program did not exist at all, you couldn’t even prove it existed! The necessity of side effects is undeniable, but we need to make certain that we are as intentional as possible about them and make them obvious.</p>

<h3 id="pure-functions--constants">Pure Functions &amp; Constants</h3>

<p>Continuing to build on our definition of what a function in functional programming is, a ‘pure function’ is one that takes direct inputs and provides direct outputs and has no side effects. Also, as mentioned previously, it is where the function is called that will be the determining factor as to whether or not the function is a function and whether or not it is pure. Consider this code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="c1">// pure</span>
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addTwo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// impure</span>
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addAnother</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">addTwo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">z</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addAnother</code> relies on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z</code>, which would be a value that is potentially unknown at the time of the function call, it is considered impure. But what if the code looked like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addTwo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addAnother</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">addTwo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">z</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">addAnother</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">21</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// 42</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z</code> is defined as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> and we could surmise that its value would not change throughout the life of the program, is that valid? Well, it is still consistent with functional principles. But what if you used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code>? Would that invalidate the above code as being in line with functional programming? No, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> the above code would still be following / consistent with functional principles. The reason being that in the above code block, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z</code> is never being reassigned and is therefore serving the purpose of a constant value in the application. If you are using something as a constant in your program, it is best to make it as obvious as possible that is what you are doing. It is important for the reader of our code, yes even if that person is ourselves, to know that they do not need to worry whether something will change, this improves code readability.</p>

<h3 id="reducing-surface-area">Reducing Surface Area</h3>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addAnother</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">z</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addTwo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">z</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">addAnother</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)(</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">21</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// 42</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now the codes ‘surface area’ has been reduced. There are only 2 possible places where the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z</code> could be reassigned (inside of the addAnother function before the return statement, and inside of the addTwo function also before the return statement). This should have the effect on the reader of making them confident that when they pass a value into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addAnother</code> function it will stay the same as the value they passed in. The constant nature of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z</code> variable is happening via closure. The above code is both a pure function and a pure function call; they both have predictability which is needed and expected out of pure functions.</p>

<h3 id="same-input-same-output">Same Input, Same Output</h3>

<p>What about this code?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">getId</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Would you consider <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getId</code> to be a pure function in the sense that if passed the same object it would always return the same id? What if there was more to the program and it looked like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">getId</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">getId</span><span class="p">({</span>
  <span class="kd">get</span> <span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">Math</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">random</span><span class="p">();</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>With the revised code, your confidence level of whether you would get the same id from passing in the same object should have gone to zero. In determining whether or not a function is pure, it is important to see all relevant parts of the program. The more that you can use the techniques outlined in this workshop, to reduce the surface area of where non-functional things can occur, the easier it will be for somebody to read, understand, and ultimately rely upon. We want all readers of our code, again including our future selves, to know from reading our code that they can ‘trust’ it. Pure function calls act in isolation. i.e given the same inputs they should always produce the same output. A pure function is one that whenever it is executed with the same input, it will always give the same output. The goal in functional programming is to design our functions so that as many of the functions as possible will always return the same output when provided the same input, i.e. pure functions.</p>

<h3 id="level-of-confidence">Level of Confidence</h3>

<p>The point of function purity in JavaScript is; how confident are we, the reader, in any given functions behavior? When asked whether or not a function is pure, a binary answer of yes or no will not suffice. The question is not a yes or no question, but one of level of confidence. Something along the lines of “I have a high level of confidence that this function will behave pure” or “I have a low level of confidence that this is a pure function” is more appropriate. The goal being to shift the balance of confidence, as much as possible, to a high degree of confidence in the purity of our functions. And remember that the determining factor, in JavaScript, of whether or not a function behaves pure is at the function call, not the function definition.</p>

<h3 id="extracting-impurity">Extracting Impurity</h3>

<p>If a function is not pure for whatever reason, what are our options? An obvious option would be to leave it as it is; i.e. maybe it must write to a database, this is a side effect and an impurity, but sometimes it has to happen. What you can do is make it obvious that the procedure will have side effects; name it in a way that conveys this, add a comment. The reason for being obvious is to make it easier to maintain the code. Another option would be to look at any given impure function and ask: Is there some way for me to rearrange the way this function works and extract out the impurity, leaving just a pure function in place? This does not mean to remove the impure functionality from your application, but to put the impurity in a place that makes it more obvious. Here is some code to look over:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addComment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">userID</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">comment</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">record</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">uniqueID</span><span class="p">(),</span>
    <span class="nx">userID</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">text</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">comment</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">elem</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">buildCommentElement</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">record</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="nx">commentList</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">appendChild</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">elem</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">addComment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">This is my first comment!</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above code block, both the function definition and the function call are impure as the function definition will modify the DOM when called, and the function call… modifies the DOM. An additional side effect above is the id being generated by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uniqueID()</code>. Is it possible to extract the impurities? We could change it to look like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">newComment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">userID</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">commentID</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">comment</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">record</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">commentID</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">userID</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">text</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">comment</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">buildCommentElement</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">record</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">commentID</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">uniqueID</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">elem</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">newComment</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">commentID</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">This is my first comment!</span><span class="dl">"</span>
<span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">commentList</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">appendChild</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">elem</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above does not get rid of any side effects, but extracts them to leave a pure function whenever possible.</p>

<h3 id="containing-impurity">Containing Impurity</h3>

<p>If you cannot extract impurities, another way to handle impurities is to contain them. The goal here is not to have no impurity, but to handle impurity so that it does not have any effect on other parts of the application. If you can reduce the surface area of impurities, this will make your codebase more manageable. Looking at the following code, try to identify impurities and consider how to better contain them:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">SomeAPI</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>In the above code, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insertSortedDesc</code> modifies the global <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numbers</code> variable. How could that function be modified to contain the impurity? Wrap it in another function!</p>

<p>Now that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">insertSortedDesc</code> is wrapped in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getSortedNums</code>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numbers</code> variable is restricted to the function scope of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getSortedNums</code>. The side effect of modifying the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numbers</code> array still exists, but it is now contained within a function scope instead of global scope, effectively reducing the impurities surface area. But there is still one additional impurity… <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SomeAPI.threshold = v;</code> is modifying the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">threshold</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SomeAPI</code> object. How can that be contained? We likely cannot wrap it in another function because this is likely a third-parties API service who’s code we do not have access to modify. Containment of this impurity might look like this:</p>

<p>The above code is a very ‘brute force’ way of dealing with side effects which would get very unmanageable very quickly, especially if we were dealing with a more complex set of state; i.e. the DOM. Capturing the current state of the DOM, modifying it, then resetting it is very hard. Same for a database. Again, all of this is just an attempt to reduce the surface area of side effects, ideally improving code readability and maintainability.</p>

<h3 id="impurity-exercise-wrappers--adapters">Impurity Exercise: Wrappers &amp; Adapters</h3>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<p>This is a two-part exercise to practice two techniques for containing function impurity.</p>

<p>Instructions (Part 1)</p>

<p>In this part of the exercise, you will contain the function impurity of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortStudentsByName(..)</code> using a wrapper function.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not modify the contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortStudentsByName(..)</code> for this exercise.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Move and modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getStudentsByName(..)</code> so that it wraps around <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortStudentsByName(..)</code> (and calls it internally).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getStudentsByName(..)</code> should receive the current list of students, and return a new sorted list of students.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure that calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getStudentsByName(..)</code> doesn’t have a side-effect of modifying the global <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">students</code> array.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">studentsTest1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">studentsTest3</code> tests at the bottom of the exercise should all print <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Instructions (Part 2)</p>

<p>In this part of the exercise, you will contain the function impurity of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortStudentsByID(..)</code> using an adapter function.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not modify the contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortStudentsByID(..)</code> for this exercise.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getStudentsByID(..)</code> so that it is an adapter that calls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortStudentsByID(..)</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getStudentByID(..)</code> should receive the current list of students, and return a new sorted list of students.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure that calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getStudentsByID(..)</code> doesn’t have a side-effect of modifying the global <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">students</code> array.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All tests (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">studentsTest1</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">studentsTest2</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">studentsTest3</code>) at the bottom of the exercise should all print <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>.</p>
  </li>

<h2 id="argument-adapters">Argument Adapters</h2>

<h3 id="function-arguments">Function Arguments</h3>

<p>Shifting from to the arguments that functions receive. Parameter and argument are generally used interchangeably, but they are technically different. The generally accepted definition is that a parameter is the ‘thing’ in the function definition and an argument is the value that gets passed in when you call the function. Put more simply, arguments get assigned to parameters. And to throw some confusion in there, both parameters and arguments can be considered inputs. Here’s some code to look at:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="c1">// unary</span>
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">increment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// binary</span>
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Throughout the remainder of this course, the instructor will be describing the ‘shape’ of functions which will speak to the number and kinds of things that get passed into and returned from functions. In the above code block, the ‘shape’ of the two functions is described in the comment above each of the respective function definitions; unary and binary. The shape of a function is quite critical and functional programmers are obsessed with the shape of functions. For functions that we create, it is important to be cognizant of their shape; what arguments will they receive, what will they return. Functional programmers tend to prefer unary functions; those with a single input and a single output, followed by binary functions; two inputs, single output. The more inputs a function has, the harder it is to make it work with other functions, the harder it is to get the shapes to fit.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about higher order functions. A higher order function is a function that either receives, as its inputs, one or more functions, and/or returns one or more functions. In the above code, the variables <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g</code> and  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">h</code> are creating copies of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unary</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binary</code> functions respectively, with the function definition <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f</code> being passed in as an argument. So, when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g(1, 2, 3, 4)</code> is called, it only returns the first number in the supplied arguments, effectively limiting, or adapting, the shape of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f</code> to the definition of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unary</code>; only takes (and returns) a single argument. Adapter and higher order functions are at the core of functional programming.</p>

<h3 id="flip--reverse-adapter">Flip &amp; Reverse Adapter</h3>

<p>Let’s look at a couple of adapter functions; flip and reverse. Starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flip</code>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">flip</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fn</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">fn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">arg2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">arg1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">f</span><span class="p">(...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">g</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">flip</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">f</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">g</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// [2, 1, 3, 4]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flip</code> is a function that…flips the order of some of the supplied arguments; in the above example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flip</code> flips the first two of the supplied arguments. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flip</code> is a common method that you might find in utility libraries. A somewhat less common example that you may come across is a reverse arguments method. That looks something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">reverseArgs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fn</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">reversed</span><span class="p">(...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">fn</span><span class="p">(...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">reverse</span><span class="p">());</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">f</span><span class="p">(...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">g</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">reverseArgs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">f</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">g</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// [4, 3, 2, 1]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This may not be a situation you come across, but the above will reverse the supplied arguments that are passed in. When you find yourself struggling to ‘fit’ together functions that have different shapes, can you refactor the functions to make them better fit one another or do you need to write an adapter function to make them fit? While it is possible to make a variety of utility functions to modify the shape of other functions, it is best practice to try and write your functions as close to a familiar functional programming approach as possible so that it is familiar at a glance without some reader of your code having to trace all of the transformations and shape changes.</p>

<h3 id="spread-adapter">Spread Adapter</h3>

<p>Another of shape adaptation that commonly occurs in functional programming is having a function that takes numerous individual arguments, but you want to call that function with an array. To do this, we can use the spread operator:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">spreadArgs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fn</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">spread</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">fn</span><span class="p">(...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">z</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">w</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">z</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">w</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">g</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">spreadArgs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">f</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">g</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">]);</span> <span class="c1">// 10</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The spread operator is the same as JavaScript’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.apply</code> method; it ‘spreads’ the array out so that each value becomes it’s own value, separate from the array.</p>

<h2 id="point-free">Point Free</h2>

<h3 id="equational-reasoning">Equational Reasoning</h3>

<p>What is point-free? Point-free is a way of defining a function without actually writing anything in the function; a way of making a function by making it with other functions. More specifically, point-free is a way of defining a function without needing to define its ‘points’, aka, its inputs. Check out this code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">getPerson</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">onPerson</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">person</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">renderPerson</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">person</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">})</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above code has a callback passed in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onPerson</code> which passed on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">person</code> input to another function, in the above case; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">renderPerson</code>. The input, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">person</code>, is the ‘point’. What if you could define the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onPerson</code> function without needing to list the ‘point’ at all? Since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onPerson</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">renderPerson</code> have the same ‘shape’, you could just pass <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">renderPerson</code> as the argument to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getPerson</code>; i.e.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">getPerson</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">renderPerson</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Doing the above is called equational reasoning. Equational reasoning means reason about this thing and say that it is equationally, not equal in the identity sense, but equal in the shape sense with another thing. Equational reasoning is just one aspect of the ‘family’ called point-free, and in the next few sections it might become increasingly difficult to follow, but don’t despair. Try the things and they will become more familiar and easier to understand. Once you do understand how to implement point-free, try not to go overboard, it can have the unintended side-effect of making your code less readable which is not the point of functional programming.</p>

<h3 id="point-free-refactor">Point Free Refactor</h3>

<p>Our goal is to make the shape of our functions similar, let’s look at some code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">isOdd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">v</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">v</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">isEven</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">v</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="nx">isOdd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">v</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">isEven</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// true</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above code, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isEven</code> is defined in terms of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isOdd</code>, specifically checking whether <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v % 2 == 1</code> returns false. This is beneficial for the sake of readability and to create the relationship between the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isOdd</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isEven</code> function definitions. Going further, would it be possible to define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isEven</code> in a point-free way? Before we do that, what even is the point of point-free? Point-free moves us closer to a declarative style of code. The approach we are going to take is to implement another Higher Order Function (HOF) as we had done in a previous section. Like so:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">not</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fn</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">negated</span><span class="p">(...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="nx">fn</span><span class="p">(...</span><span class="nx">args</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">isOdd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">v</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">v</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">isEven</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">not</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">isOdd</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">isEven</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// true</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The refactored code makes more obvious the relationship between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isEven</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isOdd</code> which arguably improves readability in the code.</p>

<h3 id="point-free-exercise">Point Free Exercise</h3>

<p>This is an exercise to practice point-free style.</p>

<p>Instructions</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Refactor the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">output(..)</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printIf(..)</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isLongEnough(..)</code> functions to use point-free style.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hints:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some browsers require <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">console.log(..)</code> to run against the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">console</code> context , so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f = console.log; f(..)</code> fails (because of lost <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">this</code> binding).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bind(..)</code> to be safe.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printIf(..)</code> can be expressed in terms of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">when(..)</code> that looks like:</li>

<p>We’ll cover these advanced point-free techniques later in this workshop, but here is a preview:</p>

<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above methods are something that you could find in a functional programming utility library, but we’ll break them down. Both the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mod</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eq</code> functions take two arguments, first <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code>, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code>. This might seem strange, but it makes them more predictable. In functional programming, the order of parameters is important and should be considered. Adding on to the above code, let’s stub out an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isOdd</code> function that uses both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mod</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eq</code>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">mod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">forX</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">forX</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">mod2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">mod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">eq1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">isOdd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">eq1</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">mod2</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above code, specifically in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isOdd</code> function definition, you may notice that the return value of executing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mod2</code> is immediately passed in to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eq1</code>, this is known as composition. Now let’s make <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isOdd</code> into a point-free function:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">mod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">forX</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">forX</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">mod2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">mod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">eq1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">compose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fn2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">fn1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">composed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">v</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">fn2</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">fn1</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">v</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">isOdd</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">compose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">eq1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">mod2</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We’ve added a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">compose</code> function which will compose two functions for us, but there is still an additional measure we could take to make our code more implicit and get rid of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var mod2</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var eq1</code> variables:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">mod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="p">}</span>

<p>All of this was achieved using equational reasoning which is the core of being able to do point-free style code. This may feel way too advanced and more confusing that helpful, but the point is exposure and the real understanding and comfort with this paradigm will come from practice and from being able to speak to your code which will reinforce your knowledge and comfort level.</p>

<h2 id="closure">Closure</h2>

<h3 id="closure-1">Closure</h3>

<p>We’ve already used/seen closure a few times in this workshop, but let’s get a definition for exactly what closure is. It is virtually impossible to be any good at functional programming without a solid understanding of what closure is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Closure is when a function “remembers” the variables around it even when that function is executed elsewhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is an example of closure:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span>  <span class="nx">makeCounter</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">counter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">increment</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="o">++</span><span class="nx">counter</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">makeCounter</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="nx">c</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// 1</span>
<span class="nx">c</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// 2</span>
<span class="nx">c</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// 3</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The example above clearly illustrates closure, but when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c</code> is set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">makeCounter</code> than repeatedly called, are the function calls; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c()</code>, pure function calls? Nope. Every time <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">c()</code> is called, it returns a different value. The takeaway of which is; closure is not necessarily functionally pure. This isn’t to suggest that closure cannot be used in functional theory, it can. Here are some examples of using closure in a way that is consistent with functional style, that produces a pure function.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">unary</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fn</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">one</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">arg</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">fn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">arg</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unary</code> function, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">one</code> function retains access to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fn</code> parameter, This is closure and it is considered in functional programming to be pure. Here’s another example we have already seen:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addAnother</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">z</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addTwo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">z</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addTwo</code> is ‘closed’ over the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">z</code> variable, which it is able to use in the final return statement; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return x + y + z</code>. Both the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unary</code> function  and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addAnother</code> function reference variables that are outside of themselves, but it is ‘safe’ from a functional programming perspective because the values of the referenced variables do not change.</p>

<h3 id="closure-exercise">Closure Exercise</h3>

<p>This is an exercise to practice closure.</p>

<p>Instructions</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strBuilder(..)</code> so that it can take a string and return back a function.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> For purposes of this exercise, assume that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strBuilder(..)</code> itself is always called with a string initially.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each call to a function here, if a string is passed, a function should be returned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a non-string is passed (such as passing no argument), a string value should be returned, which is the concatenation of all the passed in strings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hints:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">typeof foo == "string"</code> to test if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> is a string.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Look at the test cases at the bottom of the exercise file to clarify any questions about expected behavior.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Ensure your function(s) are pure. Avoid mutating a closed over variable, which would be a side-effect.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">A</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">repeater</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">A</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// "AAAAAAAAAA"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As long as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> variable retains its relationship to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repeater</code> function with the argument of 10; i.e. it is not reassigned, it will always return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AAAAAAAAAA</code>. The function call is when the ‘work’ of making the string of A’s happens, this is considered to be deferred or lazy. But why would you want to defer the work? You would want to defer the work of a function if you are uncertain the frequency at which that function will be used; i.e. maybe you only need to call a function 10% of the time, it would not make sense to have it always run. The downside of this lazy or deferred approach is having to call the function and do the work every time it is called. The opposite approach to lazy is eager, which would look like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">repeater</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">count</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">str</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="dl">""</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">padStart</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">count</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">A</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">allTheAs</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">str</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">A</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">repeater</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">A</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// "AAAAAAAAAA"</span>
<span class="nx">A</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// "AAAAAAAAAA"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, the work of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repeater</code> functions execution has moved to when it is assigned to the variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> instead of when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A()</code> is called, meaning that the return value of executing the function has already been stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> at the time of its declaration. The benefit of the eager approach is that the work is only done once. The downside of the eager approach is that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> may never get called in which case we’ve ‘wasted’ having done the work up-front for storing a value that is never used. In these examples the ‘cost’ of executing vs. not is trivial, but if one were doing more intensive and complex executions, the value of choosing lazy over eager (or vice versa) would become a more important decision. Either approach is possible thanks to closure.</p>

<h3 id="memoization">Memoization</h3>

<p>What if we want to do the work of the function in the last section, but only want to do the work when it has been asked for and we want to do it only once? Maybe we could have a way to detect whether or not the work had been done, and if it had been done, not do it again? That approach might look like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">repeater</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">count</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">str</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">allTheAs</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">str</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kc">undefined</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="nx">str</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="dl">""</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">padStart</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">count</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">A</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">str</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">A</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">repeater</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">A</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// "AAAAAAAAAA"</span>
<span class="nx">A</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// "AAAAAAAAAA"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, the only time <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str</code> will be undefined is at the first call, in which case the work will execute. Once it has executed once, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str</code> will no longer be undefined and it will just return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str</code> instead of doing the work again. The only ‘problem’, from a functional programming perspective, is that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str</code> variable changes over time from undefined to whatever the eventual string is. The function call itself is pure, but the function definition is not obviously pure. Functional programming is not useful unless it is both readable and pure. In other words, the style of this code produces a low-degree of confidence in the mind of a functional programmer. What if there was a way of achieving the performance benefit of having a lazy function that only executes once when called, but does so in a declarative way? There’s a utility for that! The utility is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memoize</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">repeater</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">count</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">memoize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">allTheAs</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="dl">""</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">padStart</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">count</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">A</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">A</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">repeater</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">A</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// "AAAAAAAAAA"</span>
<span class="nx">A</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// "AAAAAAAAAA"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memoize</code> is built into all the functional programming utility libraries. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memoize</code> maintains an internal cache, which if the same input is passed to a function, it will just return the previously cached result. Memoization allows us to write more declaratively, which makes the code more obviously pure. Since memoization maintains an internal cache, is it necessary to wrap all of your functions in it? It depends on whether your function will be called repeatedly with the same or different inputs. If the input will always be the same, this is a good use case for memoization, otherwise, you’d use up a lot of memory for all of the memoization from calling a function with different inputs, in which case this would not be a good use of it. Memoize if you would benefit from the usage pattern of the performance improvement.</p>

<h3 id="referential-transparency">Referential Transparency</h3>

<p>We’re finally ready to get to the complete definition of what a pure function is! We started with a pure function needs to take some inputs and return an output. We then added to that a pure function actually needs to have a relationship between the inputs and outputs, which is better but still not good enough. We then added that the input and output need to be direct, still incomplete. We then said that the inputs do not have to be direct, but do need to be unchanging. The definition then evolved to focus on the function call which stated that when the function is called with the same inputs we should be able to expect the same output. All of this builds on the previous, but yet incomplete, definition of what a pure function is, but is still incomplete. Here is the canonical definition of what a pure function is. If at the point of a function call you could replace the value with what is returned from the function call and it would not change anything else in the entire program, that is considered a pure function. This is referential transparency.</p>

<p>A function call is pure if it has referential transparency. Referential transparency means that a function call can be replaced with its return value and not affect any of the rest of the program. The real benefit of referential transparency is to the reader of the code. If the reader of your code can realize that a function call will always return the same result, this reduces the cognitive overhead to trace through the entirety of your code every time they see a function call. You cannot have anything else in functional programming unless you understand the value and importance of function (call) purity.</p>

<h3 id="generalized-to-specialized">Generalized to Specialized</h3>

<p>Moving from generalized functions to ones that are more specialized is a key concept in functional programming. Imagine you have the following code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">url</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">cb</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="cm">/*..*/</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">CUSTOMER_API</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="nx">renderCustomer</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>There is nothing inherently wrong with the above code, but there may be some details in the function call that are unnecessary. How can we make that cleaner?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">url</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">cb</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="cm">/*..*/</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">CUSTOMER_API</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="nx">renderCustomer</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">getCustomer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">cb</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">CUSTOMER_API</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">cb</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">getCustomer</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="nx">renderCustomer</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We’ve introduced an intermediary function, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getCustomer</code>, which only requires <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cb</code> arguments. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getCustomer</code> function call becomes easier to understand than the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ajax</code> function call. One of the reasons that you make something into a function is so the code is more semantic. The name of a function call describes its purpose, which is the key thing that we want to describe to our codes readers. Considering this, it may be beneficial to push this even further towards specialization adding additional benefit in the way of readability. Here’s that same code further expanded upon:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">url</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">cb</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="cm">/*..*/</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">CUSTOMER_API</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="nx">renderCustomer</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">getCustomer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">cb</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">CUSTOMER_API</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">cb</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">getCustomer</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="nx">renderCustomer</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">getCurrentUser</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">cb</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">getCustomer</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="nx">cb</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">getCurrentUser</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">renderCustomer</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getCurrentUser(renderCustomer);</code> is more descriptive than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getCustomer({id: 42}, renderCustomer)</code> is more descriptive than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ajax(CUSTOMER_API, {id: 42}, renderCustomer)</code>. None of the functionality has changed, the stylization of the code has changed to be more semantic. This is great, but we’ve kind of cluttered up our code. Is there a way that we could define these more specialized versions of functions without having to define manually pointed functions? Of course there is! But before we jump into what that looks like, it is important to reiterate that the order of parameters in our function definitions is important! Parameters should be ordered from most general to most specialized and you will see this being the case if you take a look at functional programming utility libraries.</p>

<h3 id="partial-application--currying">Partial Application &amp; Currying</h3>

<p>The first approach we could take to refactoring the code in the last section would be partial application:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">url</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">cb</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="cm">/*..*/</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">getCustomer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">partial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">CUSTOMER_API</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">getCurrentUser</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">partial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">getCustomer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">});</span>

<span class="nx">getCustomer</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">},</span> <span class="nx">renderCustomer</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">getCurrentUser</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">renderCustomer</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">partial</code> is a utility method provided by all the functional libraries which takes a function as its first input, and then it takes as its next input a set of arguments to pass along to that function at some point. Another, more common, way of specialization is currying. When it comes to (function) specialization, partial application and currying are kind of like cousins, related in the sense that they both accomplish the same end goal; specializing a generalized function, but they both go about it in a different way. Let’s look at how we could specialize our functions with currying.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">url</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">getData</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">getCB</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">cb</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="cm">/*..*/</span> <span class="p">};</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">CUSTOMER_API</span><span class="p">)({</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">})(</span><span class="nx">renderCustomer</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ajax</code> function call is actually being called three separate times, with an argument supplied for each ‘level’ of the function; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">url</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cb</code>; this could be considered a manual form of currying. This allows us to get specialization like so:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">url</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">getData</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">getCB</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">cb</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="cm">/*..*/</span> <span class="p">};</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">CUSTOMER_API</span><span class="p">)({</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">})(</span><span class="nx">renderCustomer</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">getCustomer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">CUSTOMER_API</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">getCurrentUser</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">getCustomer</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">});</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We can now get the more specialized function calls without having to leverage a utility such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">partial</code>. It would be nice if there were a utility that could further simplify the currying for us! Well there is:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">ajax</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">curry</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">url</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">cb</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="cm">/*..*/</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">getCustomer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">ajax</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">CUSTOMER_API</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">getCurrentUser</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">getCustomer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curry</code> utility adapts the passed in function into one that only accepts one input at a time. In other words, it creates a wrapper adapted function who’s job it is to keep returning a new function that expects another input, until you have provided the specified number of inputs; in the above code that’d be 3.</p>

<h3 id="partial-application--currying-comparison">Partial Application &amp; Currying Comparison</h3>

<p>So we have the same output with currying that we had with partial application. The major difference is that with partial application we had to call the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">partial</code> utility function numerous times versus currying where we only had to call the utility function for currying once. Functional programmers prefer currying over partial application because they tend to prefer unary functions; single input, single output; which currying is. Here’s a summary of partial application versus currying:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Both are specialization techniques</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Partial Application presets some arguments now, receives the rest on the next call</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Currying does not preset any arguments, receives each argument one at a time</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you’re ever asked in an interview what’s the difference between partial application and currying, the answer is; both of them specialize, but they do it differently; partial application takes some input now, the rest later, currying takes no input now, each input one at a time.</p>

<p>Q: Why does Partial Application still exist in functional programming?</p>

<p>A: Because, aside from it being a part of the historic canonical definition of functional programming, there are some cases where it would be more convenient to do Partial Application over Currying. For example, consider you have a function that starts out expecting five inputs, and you want to produce another function that expects three inputs, i.e. you only want to preset two of the inputs. If you were to curry this, you’d have to call it twice, and the function that you get back would not be one that is expecting three inputs, but a curried function of three more chains, which might not be the shape of function that you want to pass around. In this case, it might be that Partial Application produces a more preferable shape.</p>

<p>Consider the following code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="p">});</span>

<span class="c1">// [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Why in the above <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.map</code> could you not directly pass the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add</code> function instead of how it is implemented above? Because they have different shapes. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add</code> is a binary function while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">map</code> is expecting a unary function. In the above code, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addOne</code> is changing the shape by pre-specifying one of the inputs. But it might be even better to have a curried version like so:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<p>While both function the same, using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curry</code> is arguably better for readability, and this is an extremely common pattern in functional programming. You will see this all the time if you are working in a functional programming environment. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curry</code> function above is something that would be provided by a functional programming utility library and is out of the scope of this workshop to show / describe.</p>

<h2 id="composition">Composition</h2>

<h3 id="composition-illustration">Composition Illustration</h3>

<p>Composition is the idea of one functions output becoming the input to another function. Here’s an example of some code that could benefit from composition:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">minus2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">increment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// add shipping rate</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">tmp</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">increment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">tmp</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">triple</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">tmp</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">totalCost</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">basePrice</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">minus2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">tmp</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Although we do not see what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basePrice</code> is, the code is easy enough to follow. Could it be improved? We will expand on this while working through what composition is. In the above code, there are a couple of things happening that we could abstract further; the calculation of the shipping rate and the calculation of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">totalCost</code>. But what is abstraction? The original idea of abstraction was to tease apart two things which were otherwise intertwined together, so that they are separate, and by way of separation, we insert between them a semantic boundary. Abstraction is not about hiding anything, but about separation. The idea behind separation is that we should be able to look at the pieces of our code and understand them as individuals. But how could we abstract(separate) the above code? Well, since you asked… We could do something like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">minus2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">triple</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">increment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// add shipping rate</span>
<span class="nx">totalCost</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">basePrice</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">minus2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">triple</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">increment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">)));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice how we are now nesting the function calls which allows us to get rid of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tmp</code> variable. The nested function calls are a form of composition. This works, but the separation(abstraction) is still incomplete; the shipping is being calculated within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">totalCost</code> variable. What if there were a shipping cost function?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">minus2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// add shipping rate</span>
<span class="nx">totalCost</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">basePrice</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">shippingRate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above result is definitely cleaner, because the concerns have been separated. AKA abstraction. The semantic boundary that we’ve inserted is the function name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shippingRate</code>.</p>

<h3 id="declarative-data-flow">Declarative Data Flow</h3>

<p>So far, the abstraction and composition of our code has progressed nicely, but what if there were numerous shipping rates to handle? Could we further modify our code to accommodate them? Well, currently, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shippingRate</code> function is essentially handling the execution of 3 different functions, maybe we could create a utility function that could accommodate this.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">composeThree</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fn3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">fn2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">fn1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">composed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">v</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">fn3</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fn2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fn1</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">v</span><span class="p">)));</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now, with our new utility function, we can refactor our code to look like so:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">minus2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">increment</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">shippingRate</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">composeThree</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">minus2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">triple</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">increment</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="c1">// calculate and add shipping rate</span>
<span class="nx">totalCost</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">basePrice</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">shippingRate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Using the utility function, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shippingRate</code> can change according to what functions are passed into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">composeThree</code>. Composition works from right to left, which is why in the utility function definition we’ve structured the arguments from fn3 to fn1, because they will execute in the ‘reverse’ or right to left order. Composition is critical to functional programming because the entire point of any program is to have data flow; something coming in and something being returned out. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">composeThree</code> utility function that we ‘created’ is actually present in functional programming utility libraries, typically named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">compose</code> which has the ability to compose however many functions you need.</p>

<h3 id="piping-vs-composition">Piping vs Composition</h3>

<p>To illustrate the importance of function order and the right to left execution of composed functions, take a look at this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">minus2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">};</span>

<span class="nx">f</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// 13</span>
<span class="nx">p</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// 7</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f(4)</code> will first increment 4 making its value 5, then triple 5 becoming 15, finally minus2 returning the value 13.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p(4)</code> will first minus2 making the return value 2, then triple 2 becoming 6, finally incrementing by 1 returning the value 7.</p>

<p>Considering composition, this should not come as a surprise. But what if we wanted to have the functions passed in as arguments to something like compose and executed in left to right instead of compose’s right to left? Pipes do that!</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> you only need to implement one of the two functions <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">compose</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pipe</code>. Once you’ve completed one of them, you can simply pass whatever is being passed to the other function but reverse it. i.e. complete <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pipe</code>, then in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">compose</code> you would just need to return <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pipe(functions.reverse())</code>.</p>

<h3 id="associativity">Associativity</h3>

<p>Associativity is a mathematical concept, but composition is also associative. Meaning that if you have a list of functions that need to be composed, you can compose them in any grouping and get the same result. Here is some code which illustrates associativity:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">minus2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">};</span>

<p>Associativity is useful because it means that we are able to do currying and partial application on compositions.</p>

<h3 id="composition-with-currying">Composition with Currying</h3>

<p>With the following code, how could we combine composition and currying?</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<p>So far, we’ve seen composition only with unary functions; functions that take and return a single value. Why would it be that we would only compose unary functions? Primarily because of the differing shapes of unary and binary functions. Again, how would it be possible to compose the three functions in the code above? Possibly something like this which basically turns the binary functions into unary functions:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">divBy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">divBy</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">triple</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// 12</span>

<span class="nx">sum</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">curry</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">sum</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">composeThree</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="nx">divBy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">),</span>

<span class="p">)(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that we’ve seen composition and currying together in action, let’s take another look at point free, with this before seen example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">mod2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">mod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">eq1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">isOdd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">eq1</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">mod2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we wanted to transform the above code for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isOdd</code> function into one that is point free, we could again use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">compose</code> style of function to do just that:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">mod2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">mod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">eq1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">isOdd</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">eq1</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">mod2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">composeTwo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">fn2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">fn1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">composed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">v</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">fn2</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">fn1</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">v</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">isOdd</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">composeTwo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">eq1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">mod2</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">isOdd</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">composeTwo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">eq</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="nx">mod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above is another example of taking binary functions and composing them into unary functions.</p>

<h2 id="immutability">Immutability</h2>

<h3 id="immutability-1">Immutability</h3>

<p>Immutability implies that something is not going to change, but that does not fully encompass what this section of the workshop will cover. It isn’t only that things do not change, but that they do not change unexpectedly. In programs, there is a lot of state change, which is arguably the point of them, for state to change over time and with state change being the point, you don’t really want to stop that from happening. There’s really no such thing as making an immutable program because that program would not have any point or reason to exist. The point of immutability is that change which needs to occur, needs to do so in an intentional manner. How do we control mutation and change? There are a couple of types of immutability that we will look at, the first being assignment immutability.</p>

<p>Assignment immutability is the idea that when you assign something to a variable or property that it is no longer allowed to be reassigned to another value. Here’s an example to consider:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">basePrice</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">89.99</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">shippingCost</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">6.50</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c1">// more code</span>

<span class="nx">basePrice</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mf">5.00</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// allowed</span>

<span class="c1">// more code</span>

<span class="nx">shippingCost</span> <span class="o">*=</span> <span class="mf">1.04</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// nope</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above code, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basePrice</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shippingCost</code> are both variables, rather a symbolic representation in memory, the difference between the two being how they will handle reassignment. With <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let</code>, you can reassign them, no problem. But if you try to reassign something that has been declared as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code>, you will get an error saying that it is not allowed. Another caveat about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> is that it cannot be declared without an assignment. You may have heard of the ‘temporal dead zone’ or TDZ which is all about preventing us, the developers, from seeing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> ever in an in-between state where it is undefined. So… then why should we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> in our applications? The greatest support for having <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> as a variable type in JavaScript comes from the functional programming community.</p>

<p>Let’s look at some more code:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">basePrice</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">89.99</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">shippingCost</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">6.50</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">increasePrice</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">price</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">price</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mf">5.00</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">increasePrice</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">basePrice</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// 94.99</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">increaseShipping</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">shipping</span><span class="p">){</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">shipping</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mf">1.04</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">increaseShipping</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">shippingCost</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// 6.76</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice now that we are merely computing values as opposed to reassigning values to existing variables. This is typical of functional programming where most will tell you to try and avoid assignment at all costs. Which is suspicious as to whether or not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> is as useful as it is proclaimed to be.</p>

<p>There is a lot of baggage that comes with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> keyword. A lot of the ‘issues’ that people have seem to come from the term <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code>(ant) and the meaning that it (constant) conveys in the English language as opposed to how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> has been implemented in [insert programming language here]. In English, one would typically associate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code>(ant) with something that has not / does not change. When using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> with a primitive value; number, string; it’s no problem. But when using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> with an array or an object (yes, also a function which is an object), these elements are changeable / has mutability. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> implies that an assignment will not change, not the values within. You can certainly learn the mechanics of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> and make these ‘issues’ not a problem for you. Java deprecated the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> keyword and replaced it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">final</code> implies that it is the final state of a variable, rather than one that does not change.</p>

<p>Does <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> have provide benefit that it can overcome any potential downsides that it may present? It is the opinion of the instructor that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> doesn’t really carry its own weight. The argument being that if it is going to trip people up so much, then it had better provide enough benefit to justify its inclusion in our programs. Keeping in mind that assigning a value to a variable is linked to the idea that the variable belongs to a particular scope, in the above code, there is a very small ‘window’ of possible code that could reassign any of the variables that exist. A typical argument in defense of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> is that it is signifying intent, that this variable will not change anywhere in the code. But if we are following ‘best practice’, whether that is your own self-imposed definition of what best practice is or otherwise (perhaps you have some rule about how long you will allow any given block of code or function to be), the possibility of a variable changing should be fairly limited.</p>

<p>So how can you signal to the reader of your code that a variable is not going to be reassigned without using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code>? Don’t reassign it! And if you are doing functional programming, don’t assign at all! Or as little as possible, do assignments. More important than all of this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> business and whether it is immutable or not, is value immutability.</p>

<h3 id="value-immutability">Value Immutability</h3>

<p>After all that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> hate, we’re going to focus on the immutability of values. 99% of the problems we face come from a value being mutated in a way that we did not expect. The instructor shares that in all of the code he has ever written that he has never had a bug that came from reassignment… Here’s some code to consider the idea of value immutability:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">orderDetails</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">orderId</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">total</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">basePrice</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">shipping</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>

  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">orderedItems</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">orderDetails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">items</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">orderedItems</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="nx">processOrder</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">orderDetails</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the above code, what is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">processOrder</code> function doing? No idea? Me neither… But if there was something else after the function call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">processOrder</code>, something that relied on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">orderDetails</code> object, we would have to have the suspicion that the object has changed. One of the things functional programmers do is try to pinpoint where the bugs are going to be and avoid them before they occur by using patterns where bugs cannot happen. Value immutability is arguably one of the most under-covered topics in functional programming. Values get passed everywhere, we pass arrays and objects and functions all over the place. And we should be asking ourselves every time we are passing one of these things; how do I know that isn’t going to create a bug somewhere in my program? When you pass a string or number, you do not have to worry, but when you pass an object or an array, you do not have that same level of (immutability) guarantee. So even without looking at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">processOrder</code> function, it should be safe to assume that it is going to do something to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">orderDetails</code> object and something should be done to ensure that does not happen!</p>

<h3 id="objectfreeze">Object.freeze</h3>

<p>How can we make sure that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">orderDetails</code> object does not change when it is passed to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">processOrder</code> function? Your first guess might be, “we need an immutable data structure”. Nope. We need to say that the value is read-only. i.e. a data structure that can be read but not written to. Thankfully, there is a method built in to JavaScript; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Object.freeze</code>. Here’s that in action:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">orderDetails</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="na">orderId</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">42</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="na">total</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">basePrice</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">shipping</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">};</span>

  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">orderedItems</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">orderDetails</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">items</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">orderedItems</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="nx">processOrder</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">Object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">freeze</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">orderDetails</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Object.freeze</code> is telling the object to change all of its properties to have the read-only attribute on them so that none of them can be changed, it also cannot have properties added or removed. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Object.freeze</code> is only shallow though, so be aware that if you have nested objects of nested objects of arrays, you would have to freeze each level to get that same read-only guarantee that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Object.freeze</code> provides. But in our code above, there is only a simple single-level object, so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Object.freeze</code> will make our object read-only. But maybe it doesn’t really matter if the (entire) object becomes read-only? The real intent of using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Object.freeze</code> here is to communicate to the reader of your code that they do not need to worry about the thing changing. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Object.freeze</code> does in fact do what it is supposed to do, freeze the object to a read-only state, but it does also give the reader of your code the signal that this object will not be changed or mutated.</p>

  <p>Read-Only Data Structures: Data structures that <strong>never</strong> need to be mutated</p>
</blockquote>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">processOrder</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">order</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="nx">saveToDatabase</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">order</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above code is what the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">processOrder</code> function that we saw before <em>could</em> look like. Notice that it is in fact trying to modify the object that it received, but the modification does make sense because it is trying to update the order status in a database. But this mutation is, by definition of functional programming, a side-effect; i.e. an impure function. Erring on the safe side, you should always assume that you are not allowed to mutate something; but then what can we do? Make a copy of the object! Like so:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">processOrder</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">order</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">processedOrder</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">...</span><span class="nx">order</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">status</span><span class="dl">"</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="nx">order</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">processedOrder</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">status</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">complete</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>

  <span class="nx">saveToDatabase</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">processedOrder</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now that we’ve made a copy of the original object, we can safely mutate it without mutating the original! So now we have two considerations when avoiding mutation; 1. Do your reader a favor and signal that you do not want whatever it is to be changed; i.e. use something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Object.freeze</code>. 2. When you write a function that receives data structures, treat the incoming data as if it were read-only, no matter what. Make a copy of the data structure and make changes to that local copy. In these ways we are able to deal effectively with value mutability.</p>

<h3 id="immutable-data-structures">Immutable Data Structures</h3>

<p>We’ve covered what to do with data structures that don’t need to change, what do we do with data structures that do need to change? You cannot treat all data structures as immutable data structures, some of them are going to have to be mutable. When you have the need for a mutable data structure, one that is not read-only, what you need is an immutable data structure. Wait, what? An immutable data structure is one that allows not no-mutation, but rather structured mutation. Structured, controlled, intentional mutation as opposed to just create an assignment and have side effects somewhere. You should build your objects by first asking if it will ever need to mutate. If so, you don’t need to use read-only, but something immutable. But if it never needs to change, stick with a read-only structure. We will only use an immutable data structure if it need to mutate.</p>

<p>What is an immutable data structure? It is a representation of the data structures that we are used to dealing with; i.e. arrays, where we can access things at indexed positions, and objects, where we can access things at named property positions. It is data structures like those mentioned, but where you don’t have access to the underlying data structure, what you have only is an API to access it. The API creates a layer of control that prevents unexpected changes to the data structure. Specifically, an immutable data structure does not allow you to make any changes to it unless you switch into a special mode that allows changes to be made. You can only create a new data structure with the change having been applied.</p>

<p>This immutability is great, but what are the implications for performance? Remember, we are working in a way that only allows changes to be made to an array or object that is a copy <strong>and</strong> we’re talking about making thousands of changes per second. At best, we have a bunch of garbage collection, but at worst there is going to be a ton of CPU churn from making thousands of copies of something per second. Fear not! The way that immutable data structures are designed is  specifically with optimization in mind. In theory, in functional programming, we don’t make a new thing, you don’t make a change to a thing, you make a new thing with the change applied, which in practice means real cost like garbage collection and CPU churn. Therefore, it is the job of an immutable data structure to mitigate that real practical cost so we get closer back to the theoretical benefit of what an immutable data structure is.</p>

<p>If you use an immutable data structure, what it is actually going to do is not create a whole new copy of the object when you try to change a property, but rather make a new object with the new information in it and internally have a pointer back to the previous object. This is something like a git repo where every time you’ve committed something you are just storing a diff compared to what it was before. Similarly, the new object is effectively a diff on the previous object. This reduces the CPU usage and garbage collection. This is all wonderful, I want immutable data structures, please give?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We do not at the present time have immutable data structures natively in JavaScript 🤬</p>
</blockquote>

<p>JavaScript having immutable data structures has been discussed at TC39, but that does not mean that it will ever happen. There would be a huge benefit to the language being able to highly optimize immutable data structures.</p>

<h3 id="immutablejs-overview">Immutable.js Overview</h3>

<p>In the interim, of immutable data structures being directly implemented in JavaScript, if it is important for you to manage the mutations on data structures, you are going to need a library that provides an immutable data structure. The most common JavaScript library that provides immutable data structures is, <a href="https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js">immutable.js</a>, brought to you by Facebook. There is another library called <a href="https://swannodette.github.io/mori/">mori</a>, this is preferred by functional programmers that prefer closure. Mori has a different take on the way it works, as opposed to immutable.js, and what the API looks like. Both libraries provide structured mutation for data structures. Here is an example using immutable.js:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">items</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">Immutable</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">List</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="k">of</span><span class="p">(</span>
  <span class="nx">textbook</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">supplies</span>
<span class="p">);</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">updatedItems</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">items</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">calculator</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">items</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="nx">updatedItems</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// false</span>

<span class="nx">items</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">size</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// 2</span>
<span class="nx">updatedItems</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">size</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// 3</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>While we don’t have any details on what <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">textbook</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">supplies</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">calculator</code> are, that doesn’t really matter. When the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updatedItems</code> variable is created and we push <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">calculator</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">items</code>, that doesn’t actually happen, well it doesn’t get pushed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">items</code> but rather to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updatedItems</code> variable. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">items</code> is immutable whereas <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updatedItems</code> is a copy of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">item</code> and is not immutable. You can see that reflected in the logs of whether the two objects are equal and when we check their size.</p>

<p>Functional programmers tend to minimize the amount of assignments, but for ones that you do have, you will generally do them in small blocks and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">const</code> keyword will not provide much benefit for you. Therefore, it may be more appropriate to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let</code> if nothing else than for the benefit of the reader of your code. Another way to signify to readers of our code is to wrap the data being passed at a function call site in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Object.freeze</code>, and if you need to recursively freeze the various levels of your object, make a helper utility function for this. When you receive a data structure, assume it is read-only. If you need to track changes to data structures, you should be doing so with an immutable data structure.</p>

  <p>Immutable Data Structures are data structures that <em>need</em> to be mutated.</p>

<h3 id="immutability-exercise">Immutability Exercise</h3>

<p>This is an exercise to practice with assignment and value immutability.</p>

<p>Instructions</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pickNumber(..)</code> so that it’s a pure function. It should the list of lottery numbers and a new lottery number (randomly generated using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lotteryNum()</code>) to add to the list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pickNumber(..)</code> should always keep the list of lottery numbers sorted in ascending order. Also, no duplicates!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hint: Array’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sort()</code> (with no argument) does not do numeric sorting but alphanumeric sorting. You’ll need to pass a custom comparator function to get true numeric sorting.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Bonus</p>

<p>Instead of a read-only array (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Object.freeze(..)</code>), use Immutable.js’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">List</code> data structure to manage the additions to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">luckyLotteryNumbers</code>.</p>
