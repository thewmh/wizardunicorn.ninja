# 👋 I'm William Harrison

# As a Frontend Developer, I work mostly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but sometimes pretend that I am actually a full stack developer and cobble together React apps and construct weird queries in PostgresQL (because I have no idea).

# I primarily keep this site for ~~workshop transcripts~~ notes, there are some resources I gather along the way as well, and sometimes I will add a little JavaScript or style update that seems fun when I am working on a project.

# Built in Jekyll with the TailwindCSS and deployed with Github Pages via custom actions.
