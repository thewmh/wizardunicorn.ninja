  My name is William Harrison, I am a Frontend Developer.

  I was always seeing job posts for "Looking for Full Stack Wizard", "Seeking Frontend Unicorn", "HTML Ninja Needed", where companies seem to throw their "kitchen-sink-ideal-candidate-who-has-all-the-things-but-requires-little-pay" requirements into their job posts.
  
  Thinking it was kind of funny, while also realizing that I am some form of wizard, unicorn, and ninja (My background is in Graphic Design, Video Production, and now Frontend Development), I thought, "Hey, .ninja is a thing now, is wizardunicorn.ninja available?". And it was...
  
  I mostly keep this site for notes, there are some resources I gather along the way as well, and sometimes I will add a little JavaScript or style update that seems fun when I am working on a project.

  The source for this site is on Github [here](https://github.com/hztl-wm/hztl-wm).
  
  Built in Jekyll with the USWDS theme and deployed with Github Pages.
